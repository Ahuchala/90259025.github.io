Raymarching is an extraordinarily versatile method for rendering 3D scenes of all sorts, from <a href="/applets/quaternionic-julia-sets/">fractals</a> to <a href="/applets/thurston-geometries/">curved spaces</a>, but this time, things are a little different. By exchanging the straight line that line normally moves along for a different curve, we can produce all sorts of bizarre renderings that showcase the curvature of space, even if it's artificially imposed.
