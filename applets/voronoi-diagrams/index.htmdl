After an eternity spent on the <a href="/applets/thurston-geometries/">Thurston geometries</a> project, I wanted to take on something much shorter. Voronoi diagrams are formed by placing points in the plane and growing a circle out from each of them, stopping when they touch as if the circles pressed against one another. The result looks a little like stained glass --- all the boundaries end up being straight lines.

By adjusting the definition of a circle, we can change the appearance of the resulting diagram. The $L^p$ norm in the plane measures the distance from the origin as $\left( |x|^p + |y|^p \right)^{1/p}$; when $p = 2$, this is the usual euclidean distance. When $p = 1$, circles are replaced by diamonds, and as $p \to \infty$, they become squares. By allowing one of the points to be draggable, we can also see the (surprisingly slippery) effect of moving it in real time.
