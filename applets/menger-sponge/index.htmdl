There's not too much to say about this one! The Menger Sponge is a famous and simple 3D fractal that's similar to the <a href="/applets/kaleidoscopic-ifs-fractals/">Sierpinski tetrahedron and octahedron</a>. We begin with a cube and remove a square of side length $\frac{1}{3}$ from each face. What's left is a collection of smaller cubes, and we do the same to them. Repeating the process produces a 3D analogue of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set">Cantor set</a>: a sponge-like object with zero volume that still contains uncountably many points (that's more impressive for the Cantor set than the Menger sponge, since the latter contains entire line segments on its outer boundary, but still).
