The <a href="/applets/julia-set-explorer/">Mandelbrot set and Julia sets</a> share a close relationship: the Julia set with parameter $c$ "looks like" the Mandelbrot set at $z = c$. But just how close is that resemblance? Something we might try is picking a bunch of points in the complex plane and drawing a small Julia set at every one. We'd expect to get something vaguely resembling the Mandelbrot set --- but it's remarkable just how accurate that picture is.
