This is a behemoth of an applet --- it took two months of work, I had to learn to use a proper 3D library, and there's more than twice as much code as the previous largest applet. I'm proud of the result, though: this applet visualizes **plane partitions**, which are stacks of boxes with one restriction: the height doesn't increase when moving down or to the right. The resulting objects can be viewed in 2D or 3D --- the 3D view looks like a bunch of rhombi, and drawing a line in the center (called a **dimer**) produces a one-to-one correspondence between plane partitions and what are called **perfect matchings** on a hexagonal lattice, where every node is paired with exactly one other.

Plane partitions can be made **asymptotic** to a shape. When adding or editing an array, replace a number with a caret (`^`) to give that square infinite height, represented with slightly lighter boxes. You can also add the symbols `&gt;` and `v` to the right and bottom margins, respectively, to create 3-leg APPs. For example, "`7 >`" at the end of the first line means the row of height 7 should continue forever, indicated by the same lighter boxes.

Plane partitions are frequently studied, and many correspondences involving them have been implemented here. The first three take a plane partition and convert it to a **tableau** of the same shape --- a tableau is a collection of numbers with no restriction on box heights decreasing in any direction. The inverse algorithms take a tableau and convert it back to a plane partition. Pak and Sulzgruber are independently discovered correspondences with wildly different descriptions that amazingly produce the same results, while Hillman-Grassl is a unique correspondence all its own. RSK is something else entirely: it takes two semi-standard Young tableaux, or SSYT, and converts them to a regular tableau. An SSYT is similar to a plane partition, but rather than heights needing to decrease along rows and columns, they must *increase*, and the increasing that happens on columns must be strict (i.e. the heights always increase and never remain the same).
