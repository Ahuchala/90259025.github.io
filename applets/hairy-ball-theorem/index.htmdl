Mathematicians rarely pass up the opportunity to choose an entertaining name, and this is one of the most famous examples. If we place a continuous <a href="/applets/vector-fields/">vector field</a> on an $n$-dimensional sphere (a circle for $n = 1$, a hollow ball for $n = 2$, the <a href="/applets/thurston-geometries/">three-sphere</a> for $n = 3$, and so on), then whenever $n$ is even, that vector field can't be nonzero everywhere. Put more literally, it's impossible to comb a hairy ball without at least one hair sticking straight up.

	Drag on the scene to look around. In the Generating code box, use `x`, `y`, and `z` to refer to the cooridnates on the sphere, which range from $-1$ to $1$.
