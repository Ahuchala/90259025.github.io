This makes them jump around in very short, straight lines, not moving far in any direction on average. <strong>Brownian motion</strong> is a model for this behavior that has wide-ranging applications, one of which is the growth of crystals.</p><p class="body-text">The theory of <strong>Diffusion-limited aggregation</strong> applies to crystals that form as the result of a substance that can only move through diffusion &mdash; think salt that&#x2019;s dissolved in water and is therefore subject to Brownian motion. When one salt molecule hits another, it sticks, and over time, this forms a crystal structure. This applet colors the salt red and the water black, and centers the starting point of the crystal. The later a salt particle joins the group, the darker it&#x2019;s colored. The resulting construction is called a <strong>Brownian tree</strong>, a beautiful object that often looks more like a tree&#x2019;s roots than its canopy.</p><div id="canvas-landscape"><div id="canvas-landscape-left"><div class='text-boxes'><div class="text-box-container"><input id="resolution-input" class="text-box" type="text" value="" tabindex="1"><p class="body-text text-box-subtext"></p></div></div><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="generate-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div></div></div><div id="canvas-landscape-middle"><canvas id='output-canvas' class='output-canvas'></canvas></div><div id="canvas-landscape-right"><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="download-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div></div></div></div></section></main>
