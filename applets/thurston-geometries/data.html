The first three effectively state that lines, line segments, and circles can be constructed, and the fourth that all right angles are equal, but the fifth, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate">parallel postulate</a>, is subtler: a concise equivalent statement is that the angles of any triangle add up to <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$.</span> After remaining unproven from the other four for centuries (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate#History">though not for lack of effort</a>), mathematicians came to accept that not only was it necessary to take as an axiom, but that it could be replaced with similar statements to produce consistent &mdash; but quite alien &mdash; theories of geometry. If we require the angles of a triangle to sum to more than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$,</span> the result is <em>spherical</em> geometry. Try it yourself by drawing an equilateral triangle on a globe with its base on the equator and a vertex at the north pole: all of its angles are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="90^\circ">$90^\circ$.</span> Insisting that the angles of a triangle sum to less than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="180^\circ">$180^\circ$</span> results in <em>hyperbolic</em> geometry, in which a seemingly impossible amount of area is crammed into a two-dimensional surface. These two geometries, along with the geometry of the flat plane, now called <em>euclidean</em>, are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem">only three</a> possible on a curved 2-dimensional surface (called a <em>2-manifold</em>) without holes.</p><p class="body-text">Stated in 1982 and first proven in the early 2000s, William Thurston&#x2019;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture">geometrization conjecture</a> classifies the geometries of <em>3-manifolds</em> that have no holes and cannot be decomposed into other 3-manifolds, producing what amounts to a periodic table of geometries. There are eight in total, but all except our own are curved in higher dimensions, preventing us from understanding them from an outside perspective like we can with the 2-dimensional geometries. Instead, we can understand them from <em>within</em>, rendering scenes with light traveling along the paths of shortest distance. The results are in turns beautiful, mesmerizing, and unsettling, and quite often all three at once. Rather than describe the process too much more, the first geometry in the dropdown (<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$)</span> demonstrates the basics on the sphere, rendering a 1D image.</p><p class="body-text">This applet was a mathematically and computationally grueling project that spanned six months and many hundreds of hours, and I&#x2019;m grateful to the many people that helped &mdash; particularly <a href="https://ahuchala.com">Andy Huchala</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/aryayae">Arya Yae</a>, who put up with my incessant topology questions throughout the process and helped me avoid some of the most common pitfalls.

The top canvas shows the standard sphere, called <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$,</span> with the white dot indicating the location of the camera. The bottom canvas is the 1-dimensional image that it sees &mdash; drag left and right on it to look around. The rays emanating from the camera demonstrate how that image is formed: light travels from the colored dots to the camera along paths of shortest distance, called <em>geodesics</em>, which here are circular arcs. For simplicity, we usually think of looking out from the camera along geodesics until we reach an object. Sometimes, the paths don&#x2019;t hit anything and wrap all the way around, in which case we color them black (the camera itself isn&#x2019;t rendered).</p><p class="body-text">A peculiar aspect of spherical geometry is that objects opposite the camera&#x2019;s position, like the purple dot at the bottom of the sphere when the camera is on top, are reached by <em>every</em> geodesic that isn&#x2019;t stopped by an earlier object &mdash; that&#x2019;s why we can see the purple dot in our entire field of view behind all the others. In general, objects on the opposite hemisphere as the camera look <em>larger</em> the farther away from them we get, resulting in a bizarre sort of depth perception.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="e3-text"><p class="body-text">Our first geometry is hopefully pretty familiar: it&#x2019;s the one we live in! In this notation, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> stands for euclidean, so <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> means that the geometry is euclidean in all directions. The geodesics (the paths of shortest distance that light necessarily travels along) are straight lines, and so everything should look roughly normal. This geometry serves mostly as a control for what to expect in the others: the rooms are cubes with spherical holes cored out of them, and generally are good at demonstrating the local structure of the space, while the spheres (press the Switch Scene button) are better at demonstrating the global structure.</p><p class="body-text"><span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> is an <em>isotropic</em> geometry, which means that it looks the same in every direction. This is something that&#x2019;s easy to take for granted: there&#x2019;s no up or down without gravity, but that&#x2019;s only the case because our universe is isotropic. As we&#x2019;ll see in the later geometries, moving in different directions can have very different results.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="s3-text"><p class="body-text">Our opening example used the <em>2-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$,</span> and the superscript <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$</span> implies there should be other spheres with different dimensions. The awkwardly-named <em>1-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^1">$S^1$</span> is just a circle (i.e. the points in 2-dimensional space that are distance <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$</span> from the origin), and importantly for us, the <em>3-sphere</em> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is the corresponding construction in 4-dimensional space. Although we use the term &#x201C;sphere&#x201D;, it&#x2019;s as poor a descriptor for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> as it is for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^1">$S^1$:</span> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is a 3-manifold, so it has volume &mdash; we can move around inside of it.</p><p class="body-text">The geodesics are great circles, exactly like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$,</span> so we see the same effects of faraway objects appearing large and even filling our entire field of view. We can fit 8 cubical rooms into <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> in the same way that we can cover <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> in 6 squares by inflating a cube into a spherical shape, and in fact, this is the only geometry in the list with finitely many rooms or spheres inside it. And that&#x2019;s for good reason: it&#x2019;s the content of the very famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_conjecture">Poincare&#769; conjecture</a>.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="h3-text"><p class="body-text">The last of the isotropic geometries, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^3">$\mathbb{H}^3$</span> is 3-dimensional <em>hyperbolic</em> space. One simple comparison between these first three geometries is to count the number of cubical rooms that fit around a corner by making the wall thickness negative and looking down from above on one of the pointy corners left over. In <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$,</span> there are (of course) four rooms, but in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$,</span> there are only three, and in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^3">$\mathbb{H}^3$,</span> there are more than four &mdash; in this model, there are six.</p><p class="body-text">The geodesics are hyperbolas, so they eventually become close to being straight lines. However, the speed at which they necessarily have to travel makes the effect of moving forward look qualitatively different from moving in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> &mdash; it&#x2019;s more akin to zooming in on a picture, and it can feel like the camera is constantly about to crash into a wall. The same goes for moving left and right or up and down: distant rooms look like paintings on a wall instead of spaces with depth.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="s2xe-text"><p class="body-text">The three geometries on simply connected 2-manifolds are <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^2">$\mathbb{E}^2$,</span> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$,</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2">$\mathbb{H}^2$,</span> and we&#x2019;ve just seen their direct 3-manifold analogues. If we&#x2019;re trying to produce all 8 geometries, the natural next thing to try is taking products of smaller geometries. There&#x2019;s only one possible geometry on a simply connected 1-manifold &mdash; <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> &mdash; and sticking three copies of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> orthogonally together produces <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} = \mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} \times \mathbb{E} = \mathbb{E}^3$,</span> which we&#x2019;ve already dealt with, so we&#x2019;ll need to use a 2-dimensional geometry. We can&#x2019;t use <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^2 \times \mathbb{E}^1">$\mathbb{E}^2 \times \mathbb{E}^1$</span> since that&#x2019;s just <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> again, but the other two produce <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$S^2 \times \mathbb{E}$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}$:</span> two new geometries.</p><p class="body-text">Here, the factor of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{E}$</span> is the vertical axis, so moving only up and down looks like euclidean space. Similarly, moving only laterally looks like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> (or the intro <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> scene). The effect of antipodal objects filling the entire field of vision in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^3">$S^3$</span> is somehow made even stranger as antipodal spheres fill our view laterally, but we can also look down on them from above.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="h2xe-text"><p class="body-text">After seeing <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$S^2 \times \mathbb{E}$,</span> there&#x2019;s little more to say about the other product geometry. Something interesting to note, though, is how the zooming effect of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^3">$\mathbb{H}^3$</span> is largely gone, replaced with something more like the rooms ahead of the camera spreading out laterally as it moves forward, even when moving mostly up or down. In both product geometries, the curvature of the noneuclidean component spills out into the middle space between the two, making it only look euclidean when moving straight up or down.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="nil-text"><p class="body-text">So, why are there more geometries? Going from one dimension to two resulted in two new geometries that didn&#x2019;t exist before (<span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="S^2">$S^2$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2">$\mathbb{H}^2$),</span> so it&#x2019;s not unreasonable that there would be more 3-dimensional geometries than the five we can form from 2-dimensional ones. What we&#x2019;re really after are 3-dimensional <em>Lie groups</em> (pronounced &#x201C;Lee&#x201D;), which are 3-manifolds with a particularly nice algebraic structure. This construction produces three additional geometries: Nil and Sol, which are named for uniquely-determining properties of a corresponding object called a <em>Lie algebra</em> (nilpotence and solvability), and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(2, \mathbb{R})">$\widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(2, \mathbb{R})$,</span> which we&#x2019;ll primarily think of as arising from matrices.</p><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s start with Nil. The geodesics are <a href="https://www.desmos.com/3d/a0820f7dd1">helices</a>, which marks a new phenomenon: the previous five geometries had geodesics without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_of_a_curve">torsion</a>, so although they curved, they never <em>spiraled</em>. Objects vertically above or below the camera untwist as we move toward them since the farther away from them we are, the more we have to look at an angle to make the light rays eventually reach them. Looking in a mostly vertical direction with a small horizontal component results in a tight spiral that can flow through the rooms vertically without ever hitting a wall, so we see a large hole looking up instead of the typical series of rooms with a vanishing point. On the other hand, looking in a mostly horizontal direction produces geodesics that flow horizontally for a while before eventually lifting up vertically in a shallow helix. The result is distant horizontal objects appearing squished and translated vertically: there are fewer directions to look in that reach them than normal, and the ones that do require us to account for the twisting.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="sl2r-text"><p class="body-text">To a very rough approximation, Nil acts like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{E}^3">$\mathbb{E}^3$</span> if the geodesics were helices spiraling vertically. In a similar way, this geometry acts like an analogous construction on <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}">$\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{E}$.</span> This <a href="https://www.desmos.com/3d/5c3b0e07a1">Desmos graph</a> shows geodesics with similar behavior to Nil, but it now needs quite a bit more interpretation: the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="xy">$xy$-plane</span> has been projected from <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2">$\mathbb{H}^2$,</span> so straight horizontal lines are actually hyperbolic geodesics.</p><p class="body-text">To construct this geometry, we start with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2 \times 2">$2 \times 2$</span> matrices with determinant 1, i.e. those of the form</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="\begin{align*}[NEWLINE][TAB]\left[\begin{array}{cc} a& b \\ c& d \end{array}\right],\quad ad - bc = 1.[NEWLINE]\end{align*}">$$\begin{align*}\left[\begin{array}{cc} a& b \\ c& d \end{array}\right],\quad ad - bc = 1.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">Multiplying two of these matrices produces a third since the determinant is multiplicative, and so the set of all of these matrices forms a structure called a group, denoted <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\operatorname{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})">$\operatorname{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$.</span> Since we have four variables and one relation between them, it&#x2019;s a 3-manifold curved in 4-dimensional space &mdash; a great candidate for a Thurston geometry! Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s not simply connected: its structure turns out to be the hyperbolic plane <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{H}^2">$\mathbb{H}^2$</span> with a circle attached to every point, and those circles are exactly the holes we need to avoid. However, a topological construction called a <em>universal cover</em> lets us construct a space that removes the holes in a unique way, turning the circles into lines. The result is no longer a collection of matrices, but it is a new geometry, denoted <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(2, \mathbb{R})">$\widetilde{\operatorname{SL}}(2, \mathbb{R})$.</span></p><p class="body-text">This space is <em>very</em> twisted, to the extent that moving just a single room up or down rotates by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="120^\circ">$120^\circ$.</span> The effects of that twisting are largely the same as in Nil: we see large voids when looking up or down since light can spiral forever without hitting anything, and distant horizontal objects are sheared, becoming squished and translated. But now we also have the additional confusion of the horizontal directions being hyperbolic, so there&#x2019;s a staggering amount of material there to be twisted.</p></div><div class="info-text" id="sol-text"><p class="body-text">Our final geometry is easily the strangest. Sol is the only Thurston geometry that isn&#x2019;t rotationally symmetric about the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="z">$z$-axis,</span> meaning movement in different horizontal directions has fundamentally different effects. The geodesics are spiraled in the horizontal directions, and the space is compressed and stretched based on horizontal facing, making the camera&#x2019;s speed feel as though it&#x2019;s affected by its bearing. It&#x2019;s a chaotic scene, but the deformations remain measured enough that there&#x2019;s still beauty to be found, even as far from our home geometry as it gets.</p></div><div id="applet-controls-card" class="card"><h1 class="heading-text">Controls</h1><p class="body-text">Drag on the scene to look around.
