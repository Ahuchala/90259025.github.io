## What is it?

My personal website. If you're here to see it, go to [cruzgodar.com](https://cruzgodar.com). It contains some of the best pieces of generative art I've created, the JavaScript applets I used to make them, the novels and short stories I've written and am working on, and the materials for the classes I've taught. The site itself has been a massive attempt at learning full-stack web development, and so nearly every aspect is written from scratch, resulting in a polished experience and codebase alike.
