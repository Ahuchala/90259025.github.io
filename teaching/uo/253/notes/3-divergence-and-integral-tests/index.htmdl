As we've mentioned many times by now, this course revolves around series. The later sections will be devoted to Taylor series, the application we care most about, but there's an important question we need to address before then: how do we know if a series will converge? Unfortunately, the answer turns out to be substantially more complicated than we might like, similarly to the question of <em>how do we integrate functions</em> that took a whole quarter to answer in calculus II. That answer took the form of a handful of piecemeal integration strategies that operated very differently from one another and could only address certain kinds of integrals. In much the same way, our answer to the question of convergence will be a collection of different strategies that each handle many situations, but not all. We'll start with the simplest in this section and work our way up from there.



## The Divergence Test

Take a convergent series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ and its sequence of partial sums $(S_k)$. We can write any term $a_n$ as $a_n = S_n - S_{n - 1}$, as long as $n \geq 2$, since the difference between $S_{n - 1}$ and $S_n$ is that the latter includes $a_n$ while the former doesn't. Since we assumed the series converges, we know that $(S_n) \to S$ for some $S$. Therefore, we can take the limit of both sides of the relation between $a_n$ and $S_n$ and get a meaningful answer:

$$
	a_n &= S_n - S_{n - 1}
	
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n - \lim_{n \to \infty} S_{n - 1}
	
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= S - S
	
	\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n &= 0.
$$

Taking the limit of $S_{n - 1}$ might feel a little strange, but as $n$ approaches $\infty$, so does $n - 1$, so $S_{n - 1}$ approaches the same thing that $S_n$ does.

What we've shown here is that *every* convergent series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ must satisfy $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$. So if that limit either doesn't exist or isn't zero, there's no way the series can converge. This is the content of our first test:



### prop "the divergence test"
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be a series. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n$ doesn't exist or is nonzero, then $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ diverges.
	
###



There are two important things to note here: first, the divergence test says nothing about when series *do* converge. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$, the series might still diverge: for example, $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \to 0$, but $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ diverges. The other important point is that the divergence test provides no information on the *value* of series, divergent or not. Much like sequences, a series can diverge because its partial sums approach infinity, or simply because they never settle down to one particular value, as we saw in an example in the last section. The divergence test is just the first and easiest test to tell if a series clearly diverges, without having to do a lot of work.



### exc "the divergence test"
	
	Apply the divergence test to the following series and clearly state what conclusion you can draw.
	
	1. $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$$.
	
	2. $$\sum_{j = 2}^\infty \ln(j)$$.
	
	3. $$\sum_{i = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{i + 1} \cos(i)$$.
	
	**Solutions:**
	
	1. We have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = 0$, so the divergence test tells us nothing --- the series might converge, or it might diverge.
	
	2. Since $\lim_{j \to \infty} \ln(j) = \infty \neq 0$, the divergence test tells us that the series must diverge.
	
	3. Here, the numerator stays bounded between $-1$ and $1$, while the denominator runs off to $\infty$, so the limit $\lim_{i \to \infty} \frac{1}{i + 1} \cos(i) = 0$. The divergence test therefore tells us nothing.
	
###



## The Integral Test

There's a good chance you'd already seen series before this course: Riemann sums are usually introduced in calculus II in order to define integration. By now, we have a robust theory of integration that doesn't require resorting to Riemann sums every time we need to take an integral, and so we can turn things around, using integrals to tell us about the convergence of sums.

As a brief refresher, Riemann sums are an approximation of the area under a curve. Given a function $f$ on an interval $[a, b]$, we choose a width $\Delta x$ and divide $[a, b]$ into pieces of size $\Delta x$. Every piece forms the base of a rectangle whose height is determined by the value of $f$ at some point in the interval.

### desmos riemannSum

Let's fix $\Delta x = 1$, so that every rectangle's area is equal to its height. Rather than thinking of that Riemann sum as an approximation of the integral, we can treat the integral as an approximation of the sum. Sure, it's not a great approximation, but if all we care about is whether the sum is infinite or not, it will be good enough.

We'll need a few restrictions on the series to make this work properly. Let's look at an example where everything works well, and then we'll back up and see what properties were necessary.

Let $a_n = \frac{1}{n + 4}$ and consider the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \cdots.
$$

We know from last section that this series diverges --- it's not exactly equal to the harmonic series, since it's missing the first four terms, but when we're only deciding whether a series converges, and not the exact value it converges *to*, we can always remove any number of terms from the start without changing the answer. That can be uncomfortable at first, but think of it this way: knowing that the whole series diverges to $\infty$ means that the infinite "tail end" is always infinitely large, no matter where we consider the start of the tail. Here, the start is at $\frac{1}{5}$.

Our goal is to find a function whose integral is approximated by a Riemann sum of $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}$. As we mentioned, if we take $\Delta x = 1$, then the terms in a Riemann sum are exactly function values, so we can just take $f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 4}$.

You may remember from calculus II that a Riemann sum is allowed to sample its function value from anywhere in the intervals. Two particular kinds of Riemann sums are called **left** and **right Riemann sums**, named for the way they choose the point to sample: either the left or the right endpoint of each interval.

### desmos riemannSum2

Here the function $f(x)$ is shown in purple, the rectangles of a left Riemann sum on $[1, \infty)$ in blue, and the rectangles of a right Riemann sum on $[0, \infty)$ in red. Here's the crucial takeaway: Since $\frac{1}{x + 4}$ is a decreasing function for $x \geq 0$, the left endpoint of every interval is where $f$ reaches its maximum on that interval, and the right endpoint is where it reaches its minimum. Therefore, the blue rectangles are always above the graph of the function, and the red rectangles are always below. But because of the way the two Riemann sums are staggered, with the blue startng at $x = 1$ and the red at $x = 0$, they both have exactly the same total area --- namely,

$$
	\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}.
$$

Since the blue rectangles are always an overapproximation of the actual area, we have that

$$
	\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \geq \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx.
$$

Similarly, since the red rectangles are always an underapproximation,

$$
	\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \leq \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx.
$$

By treating the leftmost red rectangle separately and starting our sum at $n = 2$, we can rewrite this as

$$
	\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} = \frac{1}{5} + \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \leq \frac{1}{5} + \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx.
$$

Putting it all together, we have the following bounds on the series:

$$
	\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx \leq \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4} \leq \frac{1}{5} + \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx.
$$

We've succeeded in relating the Riemann sums to an integral, and the fact that the two inequalities go in different directions is the best part. If $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx$ is infinite, then our sum must be too, because of the left inequality. On the other hand, if $\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx$ is finite, then the same must be true of the sum by the right inequality. Therefore, whether the integral converges or diverges, **the sum does the same thing**. It may not converge to the same value, but this is still an excellent way to test convergence.

Let's close out this example by actually evaluating the integral, and then we'll state the general result.

$$
	\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x + 4}\,dx &= \left. \left[ \ln |x + 4| \right] \right|_1^\infty
	
	&= \lim_{b \to \infty} (\ln |b + 4| - \ln |1 + 4|)
	
	&= \lim_{b \to \infty} (\ln (b + 4) - \ln(5)), \text{ since } b > 0
	
	&= \infty.
$$

Therefore, the integral diverges, and so $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n + 4}$ diverges too.

Okay, so what properties did $\frac{1}{n + 4}$ have that we needed? Crucial to the argument was the fact that $\frac{1}{x + 4}$ is decreasing and integrable on $[1, \infty)$, and that all the terms of the series are positive. Beyond that, we didn't need any other properties, and so the statement of this result for general series requires only these facts.



### thm "the integral test"
	
	Let $\sum_{n = N}^\infty a_n$ be a series with $a_n \geq 0$ for all $n \geq 0$, and let $f(x)$ be a function on $[N, \infty)$ such that
	
	1. $f(x)$ is decreasing.
	
	2. $f(x)$ is integrable.
	
	3. $f(n) = a_n$ for every integer $n \geq N$.
	
	Then $\sum_{n = N}^\infty a_n$ and $\int_N^\infty f(x)\,dx$ either both converge or both diverge.

###



The divergence test is almost always easier than the integral test, so start there. If it's inconclusive, then try the integral test if the series matches the necessary requirements. Like the divergence test, the integral test cannot tell you the exact value of a series, but it can confirm that a series converges, something the divergence test cannot.



### exc "convergence tests"
	
	Determine if the following series converge. Clearly state what conclusions you can draw, if any.
	
	1. $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$$.
	
	2. $$\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sin(j)$$.
	
	3. $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1}}$$.
	
	**Solutions:**
	
	1. Let's try the divergence test first. We have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = 0$, so it's inconclusive. To apply the integral test, we need to verify that the terms are positive and decreasing --- and they are. As $n$ increases, $\frac{1}{n^2}$ decreases, and it's always positive. The integral test asks us to consider
	
	$$
		\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left[ -x^{-1} \right]_1^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -b^{-1} + 1 \right)
		
		&= 1.
	$$
	
	Since the integral converges, so does the series. We don't know what value the series converges to (it's actually $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$, which is very different than $1$), but we do know it's guaranteed to converge to *something*.
	
	2. The divergence test rules this one out from the start: $\lim_{j \to \infty} \sin(j)$ doesn't exist, so the series must diverge.
	
	3. The divergence test fails on this, since $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1}} = 0$. But since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n + 1}}$ is positive and decreasing, we can apply the integral test. We have
	
	$$
		\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + 1}}\,dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + 1}}\,dx
		
		u &= x + 1,\,du = dx
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b u^{-1/2}\,du
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left[ 2u^{1/2} \right]_1^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left[ 2(x + 1)^{1/2} \right]_1^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( 2(b + 1)^{1/2} - 2\sqrt{2} \right)
		
		&= \infty.
	$$
	
	Since the integral diverges, so does the series.

###



The integral tests let us classify the behavior of a particular type of series that we'll return to throughout the course.



### def "$p$-series"
	
	A **$**p**$-series** is one of the form
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p},
	$$
	
	where $p$ is a constant.

###



We've seen that for $p = 1$ (i.e. the Harmonic series), the $p$-series is divergent. We now have the tools to classify the behavior for all real values of $p$.

First of all, if $p < 0$, then the terms $\frac{1}{n^p} = n^{-p}$ are all positive powers of $n$, so $\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{-p} = \infty$. By the divergence test, the $p$-series diverges. Similarly, $p = 0$ has every term equal to $1$, so the series still diverges.

When $p > 0$, the divergence test is inconclusive, but $\frac{1}{x^p}$ is a positive, decreasing, integrable function on $[1, \infty)$, so we can apply the integral test.

$$
	\int \frac{1}{x^p}\,dx &= \int x^{-p}\,dx
	
	&= \begin{cases}
		
		\frac{x^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1}, & p \neq 1
		
		\ln|x|, & p = 1
		
	\end{cases}.
$$

When $0 < p < 1$, $-p + 1$ is positive, so

$$
	\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} = \infty,
$$

and therefore the $p$-series diverges. We already know that it diverges for $p = 1$, so all that's left is when $p > 1$. Then $-p + 1$ is negative, and so

$$
	\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} = 0,
$$

meaning the $p$-series converges. In total, we have the following result:



### prop "convergence of $p$-series"
	
	The series
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}
	$$
	
	converges for $p > 1$ and diverges for $p \leq 1$.

###



We mentioned before that $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ grows very slowly, but this really emphasizes *how* slowly: if you increase the power on $n$ at all, the series will switch from divergent to convergent.



## Remainder Estimates

So far, we haven't talked much about the actual *value* of convergent series. If the series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ converges, then how good of an estimate do we get by taking a partial sum of $N$ terms?



### def "remainder of a series"
	
	Let $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ be a convergent series and $N$ a positive integer. The **$**N**$th remainder** of the series is
	
	$$
		R_N = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n - S_N = \sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty a_n.
	$$

###



For a convergent series, we know that $R_N \to 0$ as $N \to \infty$, but it would be nice to know roughly how big $R_N$ is --- that way, we can approximate the value of the series.

Since $R_N = \sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty a_n$, it's a series in and of itself that we can possibly apply the integral test to. If that is the case, and there is a positive, decreasing, integrable function $f$ with $f(n) = a_n$, then from our derivation of the integral test, we have that

$$
	\int_{N + 1}^\infty f(x)\,dx \leq \sum_{n = N + 1}^\infty a_n \leq \int_N^\infty f(x)\,dx.
$$

Since the middle term is just $R_N$, we can rewrite that as

$$
	\int_{N + 1}^\infty f(x)\,dx \leq R_N \leq \int_N^\infty f(x)\,dx.
$$

This is a great result! It gives both an upper and lower bound for $R_N$, so if we're asked to give an approximation of a series that is within certain distance of the true value, we can use this integral to figure out a large enough $N$. Let's work some examples.



### ex "estimating the value of a series"
	
	Estimate $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}$$ to within $.01$ of its actual value.
	
	First, we need to make sure this series is compatible with the integral test. We have $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3}$, which is positive, decreasing, and integrable on $[1, \infty)$. For a positive integer $N$, the $N$th partial sum $S_N$ will produce an approximation with a remainder $R_N$ satisfying
	
	$$
		R_N < \int_N^\infty \frac{1}{x^3}\,dx &= \left. \left[ -\frac{1}{2} x^{-2} \right] \right|_N^\infty
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} N^{-2} - \frac{1}{2} b^{-2} \right)
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} N^{-2}.
	$$
	
	Now we want that upper bound to be below $.01$, which means
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{2} N^{-2} &< .01
		
		\frac{1}{N^2} &< .02
		
		1 &< .02N^2
		
		50 &< N^2
		
		N &> \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07
	$$
	
	Therefore, let's choose $N = 8$. It's in our best interest to keep $N$ as small as possible so that the next step doesn't get too painful --- we now need to find $S_{8}$.
	
	$$
		S_{10} &= \sum_{n = 1}^8 \frac{1}{n^3}
		
		&= 1 + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{27} + \cdots + \frac{1}{512}
		
		&\approx 1.195.
	$$
	
	The actual value is about $1.201$, which is in fact within $.01$ of our approximation. As an interesting sidenote, the value of this series is actually not known exactly --- in contrast to series like $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$, which has a very interesting exact value that we'll talk about later, the value of the power-3 $p$-series is only known approximately.

###



### exc "estimating the value of a series"

	Estimate $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^5}$$ to within $.01$ of its actual value.
	
	**Solution:** first of all, the terms are positive and decreasing, so we can use the integral test. We have
	
	$$
		R_N \leq \int_N^\infty \frac{1}{x^5}\,dx
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_N^b \frac{1}{x^5}\,dx
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left[ \frac{x^{-4}}{-4} \right]_N^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -\frac{b^{-4}}{4} + \frac{N^{-4}}{4} \right)
		
		&= 0 + \frac{N^{-4}}{4}
		
		&= \frac{N^{-4}}{4}.
	$$
	
	We want this to be less than $.01$, so
	
	$$
		\frac{N^{-4}}{4} &< .01
		
		N^{-4} &< .04
		
		N^4 &> \frac{1}{.04}
		
		N^4 &> 25
		
		N &> \sqrt{5}
		
		N &> 2.236
	$$
	
	Since $N$ needs to be an integer, we'll take $N = 3$. Therefore, our approximation is
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^3 \frac{1}{n^5} = 1 + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{243} \approx 1.035.
	$$
