In this section, we'll fundamentally change the way we look at and work with series. The change seems innocent enough at first, but its effects will be surprisingly profound.

Let's begin with the geometric series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty r^n$. Right now, we typically think of $r$ as a parameter we can choose before working with the series --- for example, with $r = \frac{1}{2}$, we have the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2.
$$

Now, though, we'll think of $r$ as a **variable**, specifically as an input to a function $f$. To emphasize that change, let's use $x$ instead of $r$. Our series now becomes

$$
	f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n.
$$

We know from properties of geometric series that this converges to $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ when $|x| < 1$. Therefore, we have that $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x}$, defined on the interval $(-1, 1)$.

What if we wanted to change that interval? The easiest way is to modify $x$. The series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (x - 8)^n
$$

converges when $|x - 8| < 1$, or in other words, when $x$ is in the interval $(7, 9)$.

So far, all we've done is rename a variable to $x$ and introduce a small transformation to the series. But this type of series will form the basis for the rest of the course, and we'd do well to give it a name.



### def "power series"
	
	A **power series** centered at $a$ is a series of the form
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n
	$$
	
	for some constants $a$ and $c_n$. Note that the series starts at $n = 0$.

###



To make sure that power series are always defined, we'll insist that $(x - a)^0 = 1$, even when $x = a$.

A power series centered at $a$ always converges when $x = a$, since every term after the first is zero. Some power series <em>only</em> converge for that value of $x$ and no others --- for example, take the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n!x^n.
$$

This is a power series centered at zero, and when $x = 0$, it converges to zero as we expect. When $x$ is nonzero, we can apply the ratio test:

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(n+1)!x^{n + 1}}{n!x^n} \right| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| (n+1)x \right|
	
	&= \begin{cases} \infty, & x \neq 0 \\ 0, & x = 0 \end{cases}.
$$

Therefore, the series converges only for $x = 0$ and diverges otherwise.

We've seen that other power series converge for $x$ inside of an interval and diverge otherwise, like $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$. One final possibility is that they converge no matter what $x$ is. For an example of that sort of behavior, let's look at the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}.
$$

This time around, the ratio test tells us that

$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{x^{n + 1}}{(n+1)!}}{\frac{x^n}{n!}} \right| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{n!x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!x^n} \right|
	
	&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{x}{n + 1} \right|
	
	&= 0.
$$

Therefore, the series always converges, regardless of the value of $x$.

It turns out that these are the *only* three possibilities for the convergence of a power series --- and in fact, when they converge for $x$ in some interval, we can be more precise about what that interval looks like.



### thm "convergence of power series"
	
	Let
	
	$$
		f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n(x - a)^n
	$$
	
	be a power series centered at $a$. Then one of the following must be true:
	
	1. $f$ converges when $x = a$ and diverges for all other $x$.
	
	2. $f$ converges when $x$ is in some interval centered at $a$ and diverges otherwise.
	
	3. $f$ converges for all values of $x$.

###



In case 2, what we mean by an interval centered at $a$ is something of the form $(a - R, a + R)$, where $R$ is some positive number. For example, the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ has $R = 1$, since it converges on $(-1, 1)$. The interval of convergence can also sometimes include its endpoints, which we denote with square brackets, as in $[a - R, a + R]$.

These three cases can all be collected into one, and it even helpfully comes along with its own definition.



### def "radius of convergence"

	Let $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n(x - a)^n$ be a power series centered at $a$. The **radius of convergence** $R$ of $f$ is half the width of the interval on which $f$ converges. If $f$ converges only at $a$, we say $R = 0$, and if it converges everywhere, we say $R = \infty$.

###



For example, $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ has a radius of convergence of $R = 1$, and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n!x^n$ has $R = 0$.



### exc "radius of convergence"
	
	Find the radius and interval of convergence of the following series.
	
	1. $$f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(x + 1)^n}{2^n(n + 1)}$$.
	
	2. $$g(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{\sqrt{n}}$$.
	
	**Solutions:**
	
	1. With all the exponents (and no $n$s in the bases), let's try the ratio test. We have
	
	$$
		r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{(x + 1)^{n + 1}}{2^{n + 1}(n + 2)}}{\frac{(x + 1)^n}{2^n(n + 1)}} \right|
		
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(x + 1)^{n + 1}2^n(n + 1)}{(x + 1)^n 2^{n + 1}(n + 2)} \right|
		
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(x + 1)(n + 1)}{2(n + 2)} \right|
		
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} |x + 1| \frac{n + 1}{2n + 4}
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} |x + 1|.
	$$
	
	Therefore, this series converges when $r = \frac{1}{2} |x + 1| < 1$. Solving for $x$, we have
	
	$$
		|x + 1| &< 2
		
		-2 < x + 1 &< 2
		
		-3 < x &< 1.
	$$
	
	So the interval of convergence is at least $(-3, 1)$, but what about the endpoints? That's when $r = 1$ in the ratio test, so we need to try something else. When $x = -3$, the series becomes 
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-2)^n}{2^n(n + 1)} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n + 1}.
	$$
	
	That's just the Alternating Harmonic series, which converges. For $x = 1$, though, it's the regular Harmonic series, which diverges. In total, the interval of convergence is $[-3, 1)$, and the radius is $R = 2$. As a good check, the center of that interval is $-1$, which matches the series containing $(x + 1)^n$.
	
	2. The ratio test is also a good choice here:
	
	$$
		r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{x^{n + 1}}{\sqrt{n + 1}}}{\frac{x^n}{\sqrt{n}}} \right|
		
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{x\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1}} \right|
		
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} |x| \sqrt{\frac{n}{n + 1}}
		
		&= |x|.
	$$
	
	This time, the series converges when $|x| < 1$, or equivalently, when $-1 < x < 1$. Again, the ratio test failed to tell us anything about the endpoints, so we'll have to inspect those manually. When $x = -1$, we have
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}},
	$$
	
	which converges by the alternating series test. When $x = 1$, it's a $p$-series with $p = \frac{1}{2} \leq 1$, which diverges. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $[-1, 1)$, and the radius of convergence is $R = 1$.

###



By starting with the geometric series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ and modifying it slightly, we can represent functions that look like $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ as power series.



### ex "representing a function as a power series"
	
	Write $$f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + 3x^2}$$ as a power series, and state the interval and radius of convergence.
	
	First of all, if we're going to use the fact that $\frac{1}{1 - x} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$, we'd like our numerator to be equal to $1$. To get us to that point, we'll factor out the $x$ and deal with $\frac{1}{1 + 3x^2}$ on its own. To make it conform to the format we know, the denominator should be $1$ minus something instead of $1$ plus something, so we'll rewrite it as
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 - (-3x^2)}.
	$$
	
	Now when $|-3x^2| < 1$, this is equal to
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3x^2)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n}.
	$$
	
	Now we just need to multiply by $x$, which increases the power on $x$ by 1:
	
	$$
		f(x) &= x\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n}
		
		&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n + 1}.
	$$
	
	So when does this converge? We need $|-3x^2| = 3|x^2| < 1$, so $|x^2| < \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, $|x| < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Our radius of convergence is therefore $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, and the interval is
	
	$$
		\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right).
	$$

###

### exc "representing a function as a power series"
	
	Write the function $$g(x) = \frac{x^3}{2 + x^2}$$ as a power series, and find the interval and radius of convergence. Hint: $$2 + x^2 = 2\left(1 + \frac{x^2}{2}\right)$$.
	
	**Solution:** as in the example, we'll rewrite this to look like $\frac{1}{1 - x}$:
	
	$$
		\frac{x^3}{2 + x^2} &= \frac{x^3}{2} \frac{1}{1 - \left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)}
		
		&= \frac{x^3}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)^n
		
		&= \frac{x^3}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n 2^{-n} x^{2n}
		
		&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n 2^{-n - 1} x^{2n + 3}.
	$$
	
	This series converges when $\left|-\frac{x^2}{2}\right| < 1$, so we need $x^2 < 2$. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $\left( -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2} \right)$, and the radius is $\sqrt{2}$.
