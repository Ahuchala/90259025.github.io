Fundamentally, definite integrals calculate area under curves. If you stick around to calculus IV, you'll learn how to use integrals to calculate volume under surfaces too, which turns out to be the natural way to extend them to three dimensions. But right now, we can use the kind of integrals we've already developed to calculate certain volumes, ones called **solids of revolution**.



### def "solid of revolution"
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function on $[a, b]$ with $f(x) \geq 0$. A **solid of revolution** is the solid $3$-dimensional shape created by rotating the graph of $f$ on $[a, b]$ about the $x$-axis or $y$-axis.
	
###



### ex "solid of revolution"
	
	With $f(x) = \sin(x) + 2$ on $[0, 10]$, the solid of revolution of $f$ about the $x$-axis is plotted below.
	
	### desmos diskMethodXAxis
	
	Desmos is obviously not a 3D graphing engine, but it still does a pretty great job of plotting these things. Even if you don't normally, **please take the time to poke around with this one** --- there's a lot to digest. First of all, note that the solid is shown properly when $n = 1$ --- other values of $n$ are to demonstrate the process of revolution. Change $f$ and/or $g$, along with $a$ and $b$, and see what happens. Most importantly, drag the black point to look around.

Our goal is to find the volume of these things. We'll have two ways to do this --- like we alluded to before, one will end up with an integral $dx$, and the other with an integral $dy$. Let's start with the simplest one first, which is called the **disk method**.

When we rotate a graph about the $x$-axis, cross sections of the solid taken perpendicular to the $x$-axis are always circles. The example below highlights those cross sections in red --- slide $x_0$ to change which cross section is shown.

### desmos diskMethodXAxis2

Now a definite integral just adds up whatever is inside of it over an interval, creating an area. If we instead add up the areas of all those circles, we'll get the volume of that region. And what is that red area? Well, it's a circle, so we just need its radius. But we can see from the picture that the radius is given by the height of the function, which is $f(x)$, and so the area is $\pi r^2 = \pi (f(x))^2$. This leads us to the following result:



### thm "the disk method"
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a positive function on $[a, b]$. The volume of the solid created by revolving $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b \pi (f(x))^2\,dx.
	$$
	
###



### ex "the disk method"
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving $$f(x) = \frac{3}{x}$$ on $[1, 5]$ about the $x$-axis.
	
	This solid is plotted in the previous graph. Applying the disk method, we have
	
	$$
		\int_1^5 \pi \left( \frac{3}{x} \right)^2\,dx &= \int_1^5 \frac{9\pi}{x^2}\,dx
		
		&= \left. \left[ -\frac{9\pi}{x} \right] \right|_1^5
		
		&= -\frac{9\pi}{5} + 9\pi.
	$$
	
###

### exc "the disk method"
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving $f(x) = \sin(x) + 2$ on $[0, \pi]$ about the $x$-axis.
	
	**Solution:** We have
	
	$$
		\int_0^\pi \pi (\sin(x) + 2)^2\,dx &= \int_0^\pi (\sin^2(x) + 2\sin(x) + 4)\,dx
		
		&= \pi \int_0^\pi \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + 2\sin(x) + 4\right)\,dx
		
		&= \pi \left. \left[ \frac{9}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}\sin(2x) - 2\cos(x) \right] \right|_0^\pi
		
		&= 2\pi + \frac{9\pi^2}{2} + 2\pi.
	$$
	
###



That wasn't so bad! We can also use the same method for functions revolved about the $y$-axis, but since the circular slices will be taken perpendicular to the $y$-axis now, all of the functions will need to be rewritten in terms of $y$ first.



### ex "the disk method, again"
	
	The area bounded by $y = x^3$ and $x = 0$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find the volume between $y = 0$ and $y = 2$.
	
	First, we need to rewrite this as a function of $y$: $x = y^{1/3}$. Then we have
	
	$$
		\int_0^2 \pi \left( y^{1/3} \right)^2\,dy &= \int_0^2 \pi y^{2/3}\,dy
		
		&= \left. \left[ \pi \frac{y^{5/3}}{5/3} \right] \right|_0^2
		
		&= \pi \frac{2^{5/3}}{5/3}.
	$$
	
	### desmos diskMethodYAxis
	
###

### exc "the disk method, again"
	
	The area bounded by $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ and $x = 0$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find the volume between $y = 1$ and $y = 2$.
	
	**Solution:** to use the disk method, we integrate $dy$, so first we rewrite $y = \frac{1}{x}$ as $x = \frac{1}{y}$. Then the right side of the region is given by $x = \frac{1}{y}$ and the left side by $x = 0$, so in total, we have
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 \pi \left( \frac{1}{y} \right)^2\,dy &= \left. \left[ -\pi \frac{1}{y} \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{2}.
	$$
	
###



The disk method can be extended to work with problems where we're taking the difference between two functions and rotating that. Some books, including ours, call this the **washer method**, but we won't use that term often for two reasons: first, the formula is identical to the disk method, and more importantly, we'll see a method later in this section that is both genuinely different and *looks* a lot like washers, to the point where it's very common for students to get the two confused.



### ex "the disk method with a hole"
	
	The area bounded by $y = x$ and $y = \sqrt{x}$ is revolved about the $x$-axis. Find its volume.
	
	Let's visualize what's going on here. Just like in the previous section, we set the two functions equal to get $x = 0$ or $x = 1$, and drawing a 2D plot, we can see the area that's going to be rotated.
	
	So what does this look like when it's revolved about the $x$-axis? Well, both the inner function and outer function produce circles, so cross sections look like large circles with smaller circles cut out of them.
	
	### desmos diskMethodXAxis3
	
	In order to find the area of one of those slices, we just need to take the area of the larger circle and subtract the area of the hole. Since the outer area is $\pi (\sqrt{x})^2$ and the inner one is $\pi x^2$, we have
	
	$$
		\int_0^1 \left( \pi (\sqrt{x})^2 - \pi x^2 \right)\,dx &= \int_0^1 \left( \pi x - \pi x^2 \right)\,dx
		
		&= \left. \left[ \pi \frac{x^2}{2} - \pi \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^1
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{3}
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{6}.
	$$
	
###

### exc "the disk method with a hole"
	
	The area bounded by $$y = \frac{1}{x^2}$$, $y = 1$, and $x = 2$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find its volume.
	
	**Solution:** let's first rewrite this in terms of $y$: $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}$. Then the region is bounded on the right by $x = 2$ and on the left by $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}$. Those two meet when $\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} = 2$, so $y = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4}$. Then the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_{1/4}^1 \left( \pi (2)^2 - \pi \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\right)^2 \right)\,dy &= \int_{1/4}^1 \left( 4\pi - \frac{\pi}{y} \right)\,dy
		
		&= \left. \left[ 4\pi y - \pi \ln(y) \right] \right|_{1/4}^1
		
		&= 3\pi + \pi\ln\left(\frac{1}{4}\right).
	$$

## The Shell Method

Sometimes, the disk method just won't work: it'll produce an integral we cannot solve. But not all hope is lost! Just like with finding the area between curves, we can integrate with respect to a different variable to find the volume. That's a little more complicated than it used to be, though. Let's look at some pictures to walk through this carefully.

### desmos diskMethodYAxis2

Here's the disk method applied to the function from two examples ago. Since it's revolved about the $y$-axis, the disk method integrates with respect to $y$. That means we take a horizontal line at height $y$ and revolve it about the $y$-axis to produce a circle. The function $x = \sqrt[3]{y}$ tells us the radius of that circle.

What we're going to do instead is integrate with respect to $x$. That means each slice will have no thickness in the $x$-direction, so we take a **vertical** line and revolve it about the $y$-axis. This produces a hollow cylinder instead, called a **shell.**

### desmos shellMethodYAxis

The principle is the same: add up all the areas of those cylinders to produce the volume. A good analogy for the difference between the methods is that the disk method expresses the volume as a stack of pancakes of varying width, while the shell method expresses it as a sequence of nesting dolls that are open on the top and bottom.

Since we're integrating $dx$ instead of $dy$, we'll now need to express everything in terms of $x$. The radius of the shell is $x$, and the height is the distance from the bottom bounding function ($y = x^3$) to the top ($y = 2$), which is $2 - x^3$. And the surface area of a cylinder is the circumference of the edge circles multiplied by the height, so for us, it's $2 \pi x (2 - x^3)$. Now we need to integrate that, ranging $x$ over all possible radii. We know from the past example that the intersection occurs at $x = \sqrt[3]{2}$, so our final integral becomes

$$
	\int_0^{\sqrt[3]{2}} 2\pi x (2 - x^3)\,dx = \frac{6\pi}{5} \sqrt[3]{4}.
$$

Before we do more examples, let's write down when to apply all of these methods.



### thm "finding the volume of solids of revolution"
	
	1. Identify the axis about which the area is being revolved. The disk method will integrate with respect to that variable, and the shell method will not. For example, if the area is revolved about the $x$-axis, then the disk method will integrate $dx$ and the shell method will integrate $dy$.
	
	2. Try the method that matches your variables first. For example, if you're given a function as $y = e^x + 1$, that is a function of $x$, so try whichever method integrates $dx$.
	
	3. If that doesn't work (i.e. you don't know how to take the integral), then rewrite your equation in terms of the other variable. For example, $y = e^x + 1$ beocmes $x = \ln(y - 1)$. You'll also need to convert the limits of your integral. Then try the method you didn't try in step 2.
	
###



### ex "the shell method"
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving the region bounded by $$y = \frac{1}{x}$$ and $y = 0$ on $[1, 3]$ about the $y$-axis.
	
	Following the previous instructions, the first step is to notice that we're revolving about the $y$-axis, so the disk method will integrate $dy$ and the shell method will integrate $dx$. Since our function is currently a function of $x$, we'll try the shell method first.
	
	### desmos shellMethodYAxis2
	
	To use the shell method, we need to know two things: the range of radii and the height of each shell. Since $x$ is the radius of the shell and it ranges from $1$ to $3$, those will be our limits of integration. And the height of a cylinder with radius $x$ is just $y = \frac{1}{x}$. In total, the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_1^3 2\pi x \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\,dx &= \int_1^3 2\pi\,dx
		
		&= 4\pi.
	$$
	
###

### exc "the shell method"
	
	Find the volume of the solid created by revolving the region bounded by $y = 2x - x^2 + 2$, $y = x$, and $x = 0$ about the $y$-axis.
	
	**Solution:** for this one, we look to the intersection of $2x - x^2 + 2$ and $x$ to find the limits on $x$: it gives $x = 2$, so we want to integrate from $0$ to $2$. Now a vertical line drawn in the region goes from $y = x$ up to $y = 2x - x^2 + 2$, so its height is $2x - x^2 + 2 - x = x - x^2 + 2$. Therefore, the area of a shell at radius $x$ is $2\pi x (x - x^2 + 2)$. Our integral then becomes
	
	$$
		2\pi \int_0^2 \left( x^2 - x^3 + 2x \right)\,dx &= \left. \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} - \frac{x^4}{4} + x^2 \right] \right|_0^2
		
		&= \frac{8}{3} - \frac{16}{4} + 4.
	$$
	
###



### ex "the shell method, again"
	
	The region bounded by $y = \ln(x)$, $y = 1$, and $x = e^2$ is revolved about the $x$-axis. Set up, but don't solve, the integrals to find its volume using both the disk method and shell method.
	
	Since we're revolving about the $x$-axis, the disk method with integrate $dx$ and the shell method $dy$. Our functions are in terms of $x$, so let's do the disk method first --- it'll be easier to set up.
	
	### desmos diskMethodXAxis4
	
	We need to know the limits of our integral, so we solve for that intersection point on the left. That gives $\ln(x) = 1$, so $x = e^1 = e$. Now applying the disk method, the outer radius is $\ln(x)$, the inner radius is $1$, and the integral runs from $x = e$ to $x = e^2$. The integral is therefore
	
	$$
		\int_e^{e^2} \pi \left( (\ln(x))^2 - 1 \right)\,dx.
	$$
	
	It's good that we don't need to continue with this, because we have no idea how to integrate $(\ln(x))^2$! $u$-sub doesn't work, and we have no other options at the moment. Let's move on to the shell method and see if it's any different.
	
	### desmos shellMethodXAxis
	
	Since it integrates $dy$, we need to rewrite everything in terms of $y$. First of all, $y = \ln(x)$ becomes $x = e^y$. Drawing a shell, we can see that its height is $e^2 - e^y$, and all that's left is to figure out the range of radii. The smallest is $y = 1$, and the largest is the $y$-coordinate of the intersection of $x = e^2$ with $y = \ln(x)$ --- and that's just $\ln(e^2) = 2$. Finally, we now have
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 2\pi y \left( e^2 - e^y \right)\,dy.
	$$
	
	We also don't know how to handle the integral of $ye^y$! We will soon, though, and for now, setting up the integrals is the bulk of the work.
	
###

### exc "the shell method, again"
	
	The region bounded by $y = x^2$, $y = 1$, and $x = 2$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Set up, but do not solve, the integrals to find its volume using both the disk method and shell method.
	
	**Solution:** for the disk method, we need to get everything in terms of $y$: $x = \sqrt{y}$. Then the region is bounded to the right by $x = 2$ and to the left by $x = \sqrt{y}$, and the top $y$-coordinate is given by the intersection of $\sqrt{y}$ and $2$, so $y = 4$. Then the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_1^4 \left( \pi (2^2) - \pi (\sqrt{y})^2 \right)\,dy.
	$$
	
	For the shell method, we need to take the other intersection point to find the left $x$-bound: it's when $x^2 = 1$, so $x = 1$. A vertical slice begins at $y = 1$ and ends at $y = x^2$, so we have
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 2\pi x (x^2 - 1)\,dx.
	$$
	
###



As one final example, let's take a look at a solid of revolution about a line that's not an axis.



### ex "a different axis"
	
	The region bounded by $y = x^2$, $y = 0$, and $x = 4$ is revolved about the line $x = 6$. Set up, but don't solve, the integrals to find its volume using both the disk method and shell method.
	
	The key observation is that revolving about the line $x = 6$ is extremely similar to revolving about $x = 0$, i.e. the $y$-axis. The disk method will still produce a vertical stack of pancakes and the shell method a sequence of nested vertical cylinders. The only difference is where they're centered, and therefore their radii.
	
	### desmos aDifferentAxis1
	
	Let's start with the disk method. Plotted in purple is the region, in red a slice taken $dy$, and in green the line we're revolving about. As usual, that red line will revolve into concentric circles, with the outside circle given by $y = x^2$ and the inner one by $x = 4$. Since we're integrating $dy$, we need the first function in terms of $y$, so we solve for $x$ to get $x = \sqrt{y}$. The $y$-limits are $0$ to $16$ since the $x$ limits are $0$ to $4$, and so we wind up with
	
	$$
		\int_0^{16} \left( \pi\left(6 - \sqrt{y}\right)^2 - \pi(6 - 4)^2 \right)\,dy.
	$$
	
	Notice the role of 6 in the integral: if we were revolving about the $y$-axis, then the circles' radii would just be $\sqrt{y}$ and $4$, since that's their distance from the $y$-axis, but now we need their horizontal distance away from the line $x = 6$.
	
	The shell method also functions a lot like usual: we're taking slices $dx$, which are vertical lines.
	
	### desmos aDifferentAxis2
	
	These revolve into cylinders, and so we need to find their radius and height. The height is just the length of the red line, which is $x^2$. As before, the radius is slightly more complicated: it's the horizontal distance from the red line to the green one. We can find that by taking the difference of the larger and smaller $x$-coordinates, which is $6 - x$. In total, the surface area of a shell produced from a vertical slice at $x$ is
	
	$$
		2\pi(6 - x)(x^2),
	$$
	
	and since our $x$-values range from $0$ to $4$, the shell method integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_0^4 2\pi(6 - x)(x^2)\,dx.
	$$
