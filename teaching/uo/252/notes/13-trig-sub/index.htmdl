Our third integration technique is a very specific one: unlike $u$-sub, which allows us to integrate compositions, and integration by parts, which handles integrals of products, trig sub will deal with integrals containing one of the following three particular expressions:

1. $$\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$$

2. $$\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}$$

3. $$\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}$$

These might look familiar: some integrals that evaluate to inverse trig functions look a lot like these. This process will be a little more general, though. Let's start with an example to see what the process looks like, and then we'll write down the general steps.



### ex "trig sub"
	
	Find $$\int \sqrt{9 - x^2}\,dx$$.
	
	We can't use $u$-sub, since we would need to take $u = 9 - x^2$, and $du = 2x\,dx$ doesn't appear anywhere in the expression. We also can't use integration by parts, since there is no product here. Instead, let's do something strange: let $x = 3\sin(\theta)$. Then $dx = 3\cos(\theta)\,d\theta$. This looks like a $u$-sub a little bit, but we're **going the other direction** --- we're letting $x$ be a function of $\theta$ rather than letting $u$ being a function of $x$. But the process now is the same: we just substitute in for $x$.
	
	$$
		\int \sqrt{9 - x^2}\,dx &= \int \sqrt{9 - 9\sin^2(\theta)}(3\cos(\theta))\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \sqrt{9(1 - \sin^2(\theta))}(3\cos(\theta))\,d\theta
		
		&= \int 3\sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta)}(3\cos(\theta))\,d\theta.
	$$
	
	Remember from trig that $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$ for any $\theta$, so we can rewrite $1 - \sin^2(\theta)$ as $\cos^2(\theta)$. This is the reason that we did this strange substitution in the first place: it lets us turn the thing under the square root into a singe expression, which will even cancel with that root. Now we have
	
	$$
		\int 3\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}(3\cos(\theta))\,d\theta &= \int (3\cos(\theta))(3\cos(\theta))\,d\theta
		
		&= \int 9\cos^2(\theta)\,d\theta.
	$$
	
	We talked about how to handle integrals like this much earlier in the course: we use a half-angle identity.
	
	$$
		\int 9\cos^2(\theta)\,d\theta &= \int \frac{9}{2}(1 + \cos(2\theta))\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} \cos(2\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} \cos(2\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \frac{9}{2} \theta + \frac{9}{4} \sin(2\theta) + C.
	$$
	
	Now in general, this process will require us to simplify any expressions with $2\theta$ inside a trig function. There's another trig formula that's relevant here: $\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$. Our expression therefore becomes
	
	$$
		\frac{9}{2} \theta + \frac{9}{4} \sin(2\theta) + C = \frac{9}{2} \theta + \frac{9}{2} \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + C.
	$$
	
	Now it's time to back-substitute. Since $x = 3\sin(\theta)$, $\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{3}$, which isn't too bad. We still need to handle the $\theta$ and the $\cos(\theta)$, though. For the former, we can solve $\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{3}$ for $\theta$ to get $\theta = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{x}{3} \right)$. The cosine is going to be slightly harder, though. Let's draw a right triangle to help figure it out.

	### image graphics/triangle-1.png
	
	In a right triangle with an angle $\theta$, $\sin(\theta)$ is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, so to get a right triangle that works for us, we can draw one with opposite side $x$ and hypotenuse $3$. Let's call the third side $b$ for now. We're trying to find $\cos(\theta)$ in terms of $x$ --- since $\cos(\theta) = \frac{b}{3}$, we just need to find $b$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $x^2 + b^2 = 3^2$, so $b = \sqrt{9 - x^2}$. Therefore, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{9 - x^2}$. Now we finally have all the necessary information, and we can back-substitute.
	
	$$
		\frac{9}{2} \theta + \frac{9}{2} \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + C = \frac{9}{2} \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{x}{3} \right) + \left(\frac{9}{2}\right) \left(\frac{x}{3}\right) \left(\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{9 - x^2}\right) + C.
	$$

If you're thinking this is a pretty intense process to go through... you're right! Trig sub is involved, but it does always proceed in the same way as the previous example. Let's write down the general process.



### thm "trig sub"
	
	1. Determine what to substitute for $x$. If the integral contains $\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$, use $x = a\sin(\theta)$. If it contains $\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}$, use $x = a\tan(\theta)$. If it contains $\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}$, use $x = a\sec(\theta)$.
	
	2. Find $dx$ in terms of $\theta$ and $d\theta$ and substitute.
	
	3. Simplify the integral using one of the following:
	
	$$
		1 - \sin^2(\theta) &= \cos^2(\theta)
		
		1 + \tan^2(\theta) &= \sec^2(\theta)
		
		\sec^2(\theta) - 1 &= \tan^2(\theta)
	$$
	
	4. If necessary, simplify the integral more with a half-angle identity.
	
	5. Integrate!
	
	6. Use trig identities to make sure all trig functions only have $\theta$ inside them, and not $2\theta$ or something else.
	
	7. Substitute back for $x$. If there are any trig functions other than the one you set equal to $x$, you'll need to draw a right triangle.

Since this class is on calculus and not trig, that complete list will be provided on exams. For now, let's get back to integrals and try another trig sub problem.



### ex "trig sub"
	
	Find $$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 + t^2}}\, dt$$.
	
	Trying to use $u$-sub or integration by parts fails for the same reasons it did before, so let's turn to trig sub. The square root is of the form $\sqrt{a^2 + t^2}$ for $a = 2$, so let's take $t = 2\tan(\theta)$. Then $dt = 2\sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta$, so we get
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 + t^2}}\,dt &= \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 + 4\tan^2(\theta)}}(2\sec^2(\theta))\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{2\sec^2(\theta)}{2\sqrt{1 + \tan^2(\theta)}}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec(\theta)}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \sec(\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \ln|\sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta)| + C.
	$$
	
	Now we back-substitute. We know $t = 2\tan(\theta)$, so $\tan(\theta) = \frac{t}{2}$. That leaves us to solve for $\sec(\theta)$ with a right triangle.

	### image graphics/triangle-2.png
	
	This time, we have an opposite side of $t$ and an adjacent side of $2$. If we call the hypotenuse $c$, then the Pythagorean theorem tells us that $c = \sqrt{t^2 + 2^2}$, so
	
	$$
		\sec(\theta) = \frac{c}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{t^2 + 4}.
	$$
	
	In total, we have
	
	$$
		\ln\left|\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{t^2 + 4} + \frac{t}{2}\right| + C.
	$$
	
###

### exc "trig sub"
	
	Find $$\int \frac{1}{x^2 \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\,dx$$.
	
	**Solution:** Let $x = \sec(\theta)$. Then $dx = \sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)$, so the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{x^2 \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\,dx &= \int \frac{\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta) \sqrt{\sec^2(\theta) - 1}}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta) \tan(\theta)}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{1}{\sec(\theta)}\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \cos(\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \sin(\theta) + C.
	$$
	
	Since $\sec(\theta) = x$, we draw a right triangle with hypotenuse $x$ and adjacent side $1$. Then the remaining leg has length $\sqrt{x^2 - 1}$, so
	
	$$
		\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}.
	$$
	
	In total, the integral is
	
	$$
		\frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x} + C.
	$$
