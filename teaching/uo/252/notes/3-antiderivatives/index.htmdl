We need to take a brief deviation from definite integrals to work on something different. It'll seem completely unrelated at first, but in the next section, we'll connect it back to our main goal.



### def "antiderivative"
	
	Let $f$ be a function. A function $F$ is an **antiderivative** of $f$ if $F'(x) = f(x)$.
	
###



### ex "antiderivatives"
	
	$F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}$ is an antiderivative of $f(x) = x^2$, since $\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] = x^2$. The function $G(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + 2$ is also an antiderivative, since the $2$ differentiates to zero. Similarly, for any constant $C$, $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$ is an antiderivative of $x^2$.
	
	### desmos antiderivative
	
	In fact, **all** antiderivatives of $x^2$ are of the form $\frac{x^3}{3} + C$.
	
###



### thm "classification of antiderivatives"
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a function with an antiderivative $F(x)$. Then all antiderivatives of $f$ are of the form $F(x) + C$.
	
###



It'd be nice to have some notation to represent the operation of taking an antiderivative --- something like $\frac{d}{dx}$, but in reverse. As strange as it might seem right now, we're actually going to use the integral symbol for this. It may be confusing right now, but in the next section, we'll see why it's the best possible notation we could choose.



### def "indefinite integral"
	
	Let $f$ be a function. The **indefinite integral** of $f$ is
	
	$$
		\int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C,
	$$
	
	where $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.
	
###



So the only notational difference between the definite integral that measures area under a graph and the indefinite integral that takes an antiderivative is that definite integrals are written with the two numbers on the integral sign (called **limits of integration**), and indefinite integrals are bare. In other words, $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ measures area under the graph of $f$ between $x = a$ and $x = b$, and $\int f(x)\,dx$ is an antiderivative of $f$. Let's focus on indefinite integrals for the moment.



### ex "indefinite integrals"
	
	$$\int \frac{1}{t}\,dt = \ln |t| + C$$.
	
	$$\int \sin(x)\,dx = -\cos(x) + C$$.
	
	$$\int e^u\,du = e^u + C$$.
	
	$$\int x^p\,dx = \frac{x^{p + 1}}{p + 1} + C$$ if $p \neq -1$.
	
###

### exc "indefinite integrals"
	
	Find the following:
	
	$$\int \frac{1}{t^2}\,dt$$.
	
	$$\int \sec^2(y)\,dy$$.
	
	$$\int (mx + b)\,dx$$.
	
	**Solutions:**
	
	1. $-\frac{1}{t} + C$.
	
	2. $\tan(y) + C$.
	
	3. $\frac{m}{2}x^2 + bx + C$.
	
###



Because derivatives factor through both addition and multiplication by a constant, so do antiderivatives.



### prop "properties of indefinite integrals"
	
	1. $$\int (f(x) + g(x))\,dx = \int f(x)\,dx + \int g(x)\,dx$$.
	
	2. $$\int c \cdot f(x)\,dx = c\int f(x)\,dx$$.
	
###



One immediate use of indefinite integrals is to solve **initial value problems** --- problems of the form

$$
	y'(x) &= f(x)
	
	y(x_0) &= y_0
$$

The idea is that we can solve for $y$ by integrating $f(x)$, but that will leave the constant $C$ in our solution. But then we can solve for $C$ with the second equation (called the **initial value**).



### ex "an initial value problem"
	
	A snail is trying its best to get up to cruising speed. After $t$ seconds, its velocity in millimeters per second is given by $v(t) = 3t + 2$, and one second after taking off, it's moved $2$ millimeters. Find a function $s(t)$ that gives its distance in millimeters traveled after $t$ seconds.
	
	Since $v'(t) = s(t)$, we have that
	
	$$
		s(t) = \int v(t)\,dt = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t + C.
	$$
	
	Now since $s(1) = 2$, we can solve for $C$: $\frac{3}{2} + 2 + C = 2$, so $C = -\frac{3}{2}$. In total,
	
	$$
		s(t) = \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 2t - \frac{3}{2}.
	$$

### exc "an initial value problem"
	
	For as long as you can remember, your life's purpose has been to throw a baseball at escape velocity. Today, you decide to throw it vertically upward, and the fastest you can throw is $4 \frac{m}{s}$. The ball leaves your hand $1$ meter off the ground, and acceleration due to gravity is (sadly) always $a(t) = -9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$. Find a function $h(t)$ that gives the height of the ball above the ground in meters $t$ seconds after leaving your hand.
	
	**Solution:** We have $h(0) = 1$ and $v(0) = 4$. Now $v(t) = \int a(t)\,dt = -9.81t + C$, so $v(0) = C = 4$. And
	
	$$
		h(t) = \int v(t)\,dt = \int (-9.81t + 4)\,dt = -4.905t^2 + 4t + C,
	$$
	
	so $h(0) = C = 1$. Therefore, $h(t) = -4.905t^2 + 4t + 1$.
