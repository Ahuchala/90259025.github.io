In this penultimate section, we'll expand our definition of the integral to handle two cases that we previously couldn't, both involving infinity.



### def "improper integral"
	
	An improper integral has one of two forms. Either:
	
	1. one or both of the limits is infinite:
	
	$$
		\int_{-\infty}^b f(x)\,dx, \int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx, \text{or} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	2. in the integral
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx,
	$$
	
	$f(x)$ approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$ somewhere in $[a, b]$.
	
	In other words, either the range of $x$-values is infinite or the $y$-values of the function to integrate are sometimes infinite, or both.
	
###



In order to compute the first type of improper integral, we'll leave the bounds as variables and just take a limit.



### def "the first type of improper integral"
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function. Then
	
	$$
		\int_{-\infty}^b f(x)\,dx &= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \int_a^b f(x)\,dx
		
		\int_a^\infty f(x)\,dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_a^b f(x)\,dx
		
		\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx &= \int_{-\infty}^0 f(x)\,dx + \int_0^\infty f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	In all of these cases, if the limit is $\infty$, $-\infty$, or does not exist, we say the integral diverges.
	
###



### ex "the first type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx$$.
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left. \left[ -\frac{1}{x} \right] \right|_1^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -\frac{1}{b} + 1 \right)
		
		&= 0 + 1
		
		&= 1.
	$$
	
	Therefore, although the area we're computing extends infinitely to the right, it's shrinking so quickly that there's actually only a finite total amount.
	
	### desmos improperIntegral

### ex "the first type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_{-\infty}^{-1} \frac{1}{x}\,dx$$.
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\int_{-\infty}^{-1} \frac{1}{x}\,dx &= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \int_a^{-1}\frac{1}{x}\,dx
		
		&= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \left. \left[ -\ln|x| \right] \right|_a^{-1}
		
		&= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \left( 0 + \ln|a| \right)
		
		&= \infty.
	$$
	
	So the integral diverges --- there's enough area to the left that it adds up to infinity, even though it slopes to zero.

### as "infinite sums with finite totals"

	There's a good chance the previous examples seem really confusing. How can we add up infinitely many things and sometimes get a finite number? Even if that seems reasonable, why do we sometimes still get an infinite amount? Here's a quick example to illustrate what's going on.

	The sum

	$$
		\sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots = 1,
	$$

	since each term adds half the remaining amount needed to reach $1$. On the other hand,

	$$
		\sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{i} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots = \infty.
	$$

	To see why, notice that the third and fourth terms (i.e. $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$) add up to be more than $\frac{1}{2}$, since they're both at least $\frac{1}{4}$. The same is true for the next four terms, since they're all larger than $\frac{1}{8}$. And then the next eight terms after that, and so on. Therefore, there are are infinitely many groups that add up to be larger than $\frac{1}{2}$, so the total sum is infinite. Even though both their terms decrease, only the first sum's terms decrease fast enough to keep the whole sum finite. Hopefully this allegory makes improper integrals make a little more sense.

### exc "the first type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2 + 1}\,dx$$.
	
	**Solution:** let's focus on finding the antiderivative first. We can just integrate directly to get $\tan^{-1}(x)$, but let's do trig sub to see how it would work. We let $x = \tan(\theta)$, so $dx = \sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta$. Then we get
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{x^2 + 1}\,dx &= \int \frac{1}{\tan^2(\theta) + 1} \sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \int \frac{1}{\sec^2(\theta)} \sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta
		
		&= \int 1\,d\theta
		
		&= \theta
		
		&= \tan^{-1}(x).
	$$
	
	Now the improper integral becomes
	
	$$
		\lim_{a \to -\infty} \left. \left[ \tan^{-1}(x) \right] \right|_a^0 + \lim_{b \to \infty} \left. \left[ \tan^{-1}(x) \right] \right|_0^b = -\lim_{a \to -\infty} (\tan^{-1}(a)) + \lim_{b \to \infty} (\tan^{-1}(b)).
	$$
	
	Now what is the limit of $\tan^{-1}(x)$? Well, we're looking for angles in radians that make tangent approach $\infty$ or $-\infty$. Those values are $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $-\frac{\pi}{2}$, respectively, so in total, the answer is $\frac{pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi$.
	
###



## Infinite Functions

The second kind of improper integral is an integral in which the function spikes to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ somewhere in the range we're integrating over. In order to solve these, we'll also take a limit, but this time up to the place where it spikes.



### def "the second type of improper integral"
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on $[a, b]$, except at $x = a$, where it approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$. Then
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{c \to a} \int_c^b f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ except at $x = b$, where it approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$, then
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{c \to b} \int_a^c f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	If instead $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ except for a point $c$ inside $[a, b]$, then
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx + \int_c^b f(x)\,dx,
	$$
	
	and we handle each integral separately.
	
	This is just a complicated way of saying that to integrate a function that spikes to $\infty$ or $-\infty$, we just integrate with a variable bound and take a limit as that bound approaches the spike.
	
###

### ex "the second type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_0^4 \frac{1}{\sqrt{4-x}}\,dx$$.
	
	This is an improper integral, because in the range $[0, 4]$, $x = 4$ causes a division by $0$. Because of that, we write the integral as
	
	$$
		\lim_{b \to 4} \int_0^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{4-x}}\,dx.
	$$
	
	Now we can handle this as usual --- with $u$-sub. Let $u = 4 - x$. Then $du = -dx$, and we get
	
	$$
		\lim_{b \to 4} \int_0^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{4-x}}\,dx &= \lim_{b \to 4} \int_0^b -\frac{1}{\sqrt{u}}\,du
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 4} \int_0^b -u^{-1/2}\,du
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 4} \left. \left[ -2 u^{1/2} \right] \right|_0^b
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 4} \left. \left[ -2 (4 - b)^{1/2} + 2(4)^{1/2} \right] \right|_0^b
		
		&= 2(4)^{1/2}
		
		&= 4.
	$$
	
	So even though the function spikes to infinity, it does so fast enough that there's only a finite amount of area.
	
	### desmos improperIntegral3
	
###



### ex "the second type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{t^3}\,dt$$.
	
	Since $\frac{1}{t^3}$ spikes when $t = 0$, we have to split the interval $[-1, 1]$ into $[-1, 0]$ and $[0, 1]$. Therefore, we have
	
	$$
		\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{t^3}\,dt &= \lim_{b \to 0} \int_{-1}^b t^{-3}\,dt + \lim_{a \to 0} \int_a^1 t^{-3}\,dt
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 0} \left. \left[ -\frac{1}{2} t^{-2} \right] \right|_{-1}^b + \lim_{a \to 0} \left. \left[ -\frac{1}{2} t^{-2} \right] \right|_a^1
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 0} \left( -\frac{1}{2} b^{-2} + \frac{1}{2}(-1)^{-2} \right) + \lim_{a \to 0} \left( -\frac{1}{2} 1^{-2} + \frac{1}{2} a^{-2} \right)
		
		&= \lim_{b \to 0} \left( -\frac{1}{2} b^{-2} + \frac{1}{2}(-1)^{-2} \right) + \lim_{a \to 0} \left( -\frac{1}{2} 1^{-2} + \frac{1}{2} a^{-2} \right).
	$$
	
	The first limit is $-\infty$, so the entire integral diverges. Now it's true that the second limit is $\infty$, so the entire integral could be written as $\infty - \infty$, but it is not equal to $0$, since the limits are taken individually, and not at the same time.

### exc "the second type of improper integral"
	
	Find $$\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{t}}\,dt$$.
	
	**Solution:** the problem (division by zero) occurs when $t = 0$, so we have
	
	$$
		\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{t}}\,dt &= \lim_{c \to 0} \int_c^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{t}}
		
		&= \lim_{c \to 0} \int_c^1 t^{-1/3}\,dt
		
		&= \lim_{c \to 0} \left. \left[ \frac{3}{2} t^{2/3} \right] \right|_c^1
		
		&= \lim_{c \to 0} \left( \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2} c^{2/3} \right)
		
		&= \frac{3}{2}.
	$$
