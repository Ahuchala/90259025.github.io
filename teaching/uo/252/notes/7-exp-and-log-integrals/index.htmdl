So far, we know how to find antiderivatives of functions which are derivatives of common functions, and we can also sometimes find antiderivatives of compositions by using $u$-sub. In this section, we'll talk about a few more common integrals, and then we'll end with a summary of all the ones we know so far.



### ex "an integral involving an exponential function"
	
	A certain strain of bacteria grows at a rate of $3^t$ new bacteria per hour. If the population starts at $100$ bacteria at time $0$, how many will there be after $6$ hours?
	
	Let's let $N(t)$ be the number of total bacteria after $t$ hours. Then $N(0) = 0$ and $N'(t) = 3^t$, since the $3^t$ is the rate of growth of $N$. We want to find $N(6)$, so a good place to start is finding $N(t)$ in general. This is an antiderivative of $N'$, and so we have
	
	$$
		N(t) &= \int N'(t)\,dt
		
		&= \int 3^t\,dt.
	$$
	
	Since
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dt} [3^t] = 3^t \ln(3),
	$$
	
	we can divide both sides by $\ln(3)$ to find that
	
	$$
		N(t) = \int 3^t\,dt = \frac{1}{ln(3)} 3^t + C.
	$$
	
	Since $N(0) = 100$, we have that
	
	$$
		100 = \frac{1}{ln(3)} 3^0 + C,
	$$
	
	so
	
	$$
		C = 100 - \frac{1}{\ln(3)} \approx 99.09.
	$$
	
	Therefore,
	
	$$
		N(6) = \frac{3^6}{\ln(3)} + 99.09 = 762.7.
	$$

### exc "an integral involving an exponential function"
	
	A radioactive substance degrades at a rate of $-.0953 \cdot 1.1^{-t}$ grams per year after $t$ years. If there is initially $1$ gram of the substance, how much will be left after $20$ years?
	
	**Solution:** if $m(t)$ is the mass of the substance after $t$ years, then $m'(t) = -.0953 \cdot 1.1^{-t} = $ and $m(0) = 1$. Thus
	
	$$
		m(t) &= \int -.0953 \cdot .91^t\,dt
		
		&= -.0953 \frac{1}{\ln(.91)} .91^t + C
		
		&= 1.0105 \cdot .91^t + C.
	$$
	
	Then $m(0) = 1 = 1.0105 \cdot .91^0 + C = 1.0105 + C$, so $C = -.0105$. In total, $m(t) = 1.0105 \cdot .91^t - .0105$.

### ex "another exponential integral"
	
	Find $$\int \frac{2^{1/x}}{x^2}\,dx$$.
	
	This is way too complicated to evaluate directly, so we have to try $u$-sub. If we set $u = x^2$, then the exponential becomes $2^{1/\sqrt{u}}$, which isn't really helpful. Instead, we can try $u = \frac{1}{x}$. Then $du = -\frac{1}{x^2}\,dx$, which lines up nicely: the integral becomes
	
	$$
		-\int 2^u\,du &= -\frac{1}{\ln(2)} 2^u + C
		
		&= -\frac{1}{\ln(2)} 2^{1/x} + C.
	$$
	
###


	
We know that

$$
	\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln|x| + C,
$$

since

$$
	\frac{d}{dx}[\ln|x|] = \frac{1}{x},
$$

but we don't yet know the integral of $\ln(x)$, or more generally of $\log_a(x)$ for any $a$. Let's fix that now.



### prop "the integral of $\ln$"
	
	$$
		\int \ln(x)\,dx = x\ln(x) - x + C.
	$$
	
###

### exc "the integral of $\ln$"
	
	Differentiate $x\ln(x) - x + C$ and verify that you do in fact get $\ln(x)$.
	
	**Solution:** the product rule gives that the derivative is $\ln(x) + 1 - 1 = \ln(x)$.
	
###



It's not at all clear how we were supposed to find this integral out, but it isn't all that hard to verify. Now we can integrate functions involving $\ln(x)$, and for logs with different bases, we can use the following formula:

$$
	\log_a(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}.
$$

Remember that $\log_a(x)$ is the number you raise $a$ to in order to get $x$ --- for example, $\log_2(8) = 3$, since $2^3 = 8$. And $\ln(x)$ is just a shorthand for $\log_e(x)$.



### ex "a logarithmic integral"
	
	Find $$\int_2^3 \log_2(5x)\,dx$$.
	
	First, we'll turn this log into a natural log.
	
	$$
		\int_2^3 \log_2(5x)\,dx = \int_2^3 \frac{\ln(5x)}{\ln(2)}\,dx.
	$$
	
	Now since $\ln(2)$ is a constant, we can factor it out of the integral and use $u$-sub to handle the rest.
	
	$$
		\int_2^3 \frac{\ln(5x)}{\ln(2)}\,dx &= \frac{1}{\ln(2)} \int_2^3 \ln(5x)\,dx
		
		& u = 5x,\,du = 5dx
		
		&= \frac{1}{\ln(2)} \int_2^3 \ln(u)\ \frac{1}{5}du
		
		&= \frac{1}{5\ln(2)} \left. \left[ u \ln(u) - u \right] \right|_2^3
		
		&= \frac{1}{5\ln(2)} \left. \left[ 5x \ln(5x) - 5x \right] \right|_2^3
		
		&= \frac{1}{5\ln(2)} \left( \left( 15 \ln(15) - 15 \right) - \left( 10 \ln(10) - 10 \right) \right).
	$$
	
###

### exc "a logarithmic integral"
	
	Find $$\int_1^2 x\log_3(x^2)\,dx$$.
	
	**Solution:** since we have a composition, we should try $u$-sub. Let $u = x^2$ --- then $du = 2x\,dx$, so we have
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 \frac{1}{2} \log_3(u)\,du &= \int_1^2 \frac{1}{2} \frac{\ln(u)}{\ln(3)}\,du
		
		&= \frac{1}{2\ln(3)} \int_1^2 \ln(u)\,du
		
		&= \frac{1}{2\ln(3)} \left. \left[ u \ln(u) - u \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \frac{1}{2\ln(3)} \left. \left[ x^2 \ln(x^2) - x^2 \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \frac{1}{2\ln(3)} \left( 4 \ln(4) - 4 - \ln(1) + 1 \right)
		
		&= \frac{1}{2\ln(3)} \left( 4 \ln(4) - 3 \right)
	$$

## Inverse Trig Functions

You may or may not have talked about derivatives of the inverse trig functions in Calc I, but we'll need them here to evaluate a few more integrals.



### prop "inverse trig integrals"
	
	1. $$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}\,dx = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{x}{a} \right) + C$$.
	
	2. $$\int \frac{1}{x^2 + a^2}\,dx = \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{x}{a} \right) + C$$.
	
	3. $$\int \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}\,dx = \frac{1}{a} \sec^{-1}\left( \frac{x}{a} \right) + C$$.
	
###



It might look like that last one is a $u$-sub problem, but it's actually not, since if we set $u = x^2 - a^2$, then $du = 2x\,dx$, and the integral contains $\frac{1}{x}\,dx$.



### ex "an inverse trig integral"
	
	Find $$\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - 9x^2}}\,dx$$.
	
	This resembles the first integral in the previous proposition, but we need to remove the $9$ from the $x^2$. This can be done with $u$-sub:
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - 9x^2}}\,dx &= \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - (3x)^2}}\,dx
		
		& u = 3x,\,du = 3\,dx
		
		&= \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - u^2}}\ \frac{1}{3}du
		
		&= \frac{1}{3} \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{u}{2} \right) + C
		
		&= \frac{1}{3} \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{3x}{2} \right) + C
	$$
	
###

### exc "an inverse trig integral"
	
	Find $$\int \frac{1}{x\sqrt{4x^2 - 4}}\,dx$$.
	
	**Solution:** first we need to factor out a $4$. Then we have
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{2x\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\,dx = \frac{1}{2} \sec^{-1}(x).
	$$
	
###



For definite integrals, we'll need to remember how inverse trig functions are actually evaluated. They are the inverse functions to the standard trig functions, which means they take outputs to their coorsponding inputs. For example,

$$
	\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
$$

so

$$
	\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}.
$$

This isn't particularly relevant to this course's material, and your calculator can handle evaluating these, so we won't worry too much about practicing calculations with them. Instead, let's take a look at an integral example involving them.



### ex "a definite inverse trig integral"
	
	Find $$\int_0^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{16 - x^2}}\,dx$$.
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\int_0^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{16 - x^2}}\,dx &= \left. \left[ \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{x}{4} \right) \right] \right|_0^2
		
		&= \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - \sin^{-1}(0)
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{6} - 0
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{6}.
	$$
	
###

### exc "a definite inverse trig integral"
	
	Find $$\int_{\sqrt{3}/3}^{\sqrt{3}} \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\,dx$$.
	
	**Solution:** this is
	
	$$
		\left. \left[ \tan^{-1}(x) \right] \right|_{\sqrt{3}/3}^{\sqrt{3}} &= \frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\pi}{6}
		
		&= \frac{\pi}{6}.
	$$

In the next section, we'll start looking at different applications of integrals, starting with the area between curves.
