We'll conclude the first part of the class by discussing DEs of order higher than 2. We could solve many first-order DEs all of the time, but only some second-order DEs some of the time, and this trend continues as we increase the order. To get started, a generic linear $n$th-order DE has the form

$$
	y^{(n)} + p_{n - 1}(t)y^{(n - 1)} + \cdots + p_1(t)y' + p_0(t)y = g(t).
$$

Following the pattern of needing one initial condition for a first-order DE and two for a second-order one to completely determine the coefficients, we'll typically need $n$ initial conditions to find a particular solution to an $n$th-order DE. At the very least, we do still have a result that guarantees a unique solution when the coefficient functions $p_i$ and $g$ are continuous:



### thm "existence and uniqueness of solutions for $n$th-order DEs"
	
	If the functions $g$ and $p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n - 1}$ are all continuous, then the DE
	
	$$
		y^{(n)} + p_{n - 1}(t)y^{(n - 1)} + \cdots + p_1(t)y' + p_0(t)y &= g(t)
		
		y(t_0) &= y_0
		
		y'(t_0) &= y'_0
		
		& \ \ \vdots
		
		y^{(n - 1)}(t_0) &= y^{(n - 1)}_0
	$$
	
	has a unique solution.
	
###



Many of our results about second-order DEs apply to $n$th-order ones too. If we find $n$ different fundamental solutions $y_1, ..., y_n$, then we would expect our general solution to be

$$
	y = c_1y_1 + \cdots + c_ny_n.
$$

For this to actually capture all possible solutions, we need the system of equations given by plugging in all $n$ initial conditions to be solvable for the $c_i$: specifically,

$$
	c_1y_1 + \cdots + c_ny_n &= y_0
	
	c_1y_1' + \cdots + c_ny_n' &= y'_0
	
	& \ \ \vdots
	
	c_1y_1^{(n - 1)} + \cdots + c_ny_n^{(n - 1)} &= y^{(n - 1)}_0.
$$

Just as we were able to relate the solvability of the system to the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix for a second-order matrix before, this system will be solvable if and only if the determinant of a similar $n \times n$ matrix is nonzero. Specifially, we want to define the Wronskian for $n$ fundamental solutions.



### def "Wronskian"
	
	The **Wronskian** of the $n$ different fundamental solutions $y_1, ..., y_n$ is the determinant
	
	$$
		W[y_1, ..., y_n] = \det [[ y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n ; y_1', y_2', \cdots, y_n' ; \vdots, \vdots, \ddots, \vdots ; y_1^{(n - 1)}, y_2^{(n - 1)}, \cdots, y_n^{(n - 1)} ]].
	$$
	
###



Just as before, the Wronskian is nonzero if and only if the system of equations is solvable, and if it's nonzero for at least one value of $t$, then the general solution is

$$
	y = c_1y_1 + \cdots + c_ny_n.
$$

Unfortunately, computing an $n \times n$ determinant is substantially more complex than a $2 \times 2$ one. We'll talk a little bit about them later, but for now, it's just worth noting that there is a generalization of the Wronskian that still retains the same function.

Our work with characteristic equations applies directly to higher-order DEs that are linear, homogeneous, and constant-coefficient. By changing a DE into a polynomial in $r$ and solving for the roots, real values $r = r_1$ correspond to solutions of the form $y = e^{r_1 t}$, and complex conjugate solutions $r = \alpha \pm \beta i$ correspond to the pair of solutions $y = e^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t)$ and $y = e^{\alpha t}\sin(\beta t)$. Since the degree of the polynomial is higher than $2$, though, roots can now be repeated more than once. In that case, we multiply by $t$ as many times as necessary to separate the solution. For example, if a DE has a characteristic equation that factors as

$$
	(r - 4)^3 = 0,
$$

then the general solution will have the form

$$
	y = c_1 e^{4t} + c_2 t e^{4t} + c_3 t^2 e^{4t}.
$$

The main challenge now is just to solve polynomials with high degree, which is a surprisingly hard problem in general. While there are formulas for degree-3 and degree-4 polynomials, there is no general formula for the roots of a polynomial with degree 5 or higher. We'll keep things simple and look at a few examples where the polynomials are factorable without too much work.



### ex "a higher-order DE"
	
	Solve $y^{(4)} + y'' = 0$.
	
	Our characteristic equation is
	
	$$
		r^4 + r^2 &= 0
		
		r^2(r^2 + 1) &= 0
		
		r &= 0, 0, \pm i.
	$$
	
	Since $r = 0$ is repeated, we'll have both $e^{0t} = 1$ and $te^{0t} = t$ as solutions, so in total, our general solution is
	
	$$
		y = c_1 + c_2t + c_3\cos(t) + c_4\sin(t).
	$$

## Nonhomogeneous Higher-Order DEs

Let's return to the general form of a linear DE of order $n$:

$$
	y^{(n)} + p_{n - 1}(t)y^{(n - 1)} + \cdots + p_1(t)y' + p_0(t)y = g(t).
$$

When the DE is nonhomogeneous --- i.e. $g(t) \neq 0$ --- both of our previous methods of undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters still apply, although in keeping with the pattern of higher-order DEs so far, they'll both be quite a bit more complex than their second-order counterparts. Since variation of parameters will still require the Wronskian and we haven't discussed how to compute it for any order above $2$, we'll skip variation of parameters and focus on undetermined coefficients only. And there's good news on that front: the method is exactly the same as with second-order DEs! Plugging in values of $Y$ can take a little longer, and sometimes we may need to multiply by $t$ more times to separate the particular solution from the homogeneous one, but there isn't anything fundamentally different about higher-order DEs in this regard.



### ex "undetermined coefficients"
	
	Find the general solution to
	
	$$
		y''' + 3y'' + 3y' + y = t + 125e^t\sin(t).
	$$
	
	The homogeneous version has a characteristic equation $r^3 + 3r^2 + 3r + 1 = 0$, which factors as $(r + 1)^3$. Therefore, the general solution is
	
	$$
		y = c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 t e^{-t} + c_3 t^2 e^{-t}.
	$$
	
	We'll handle each of the two terms on the right separately. First of all, we have $t$, which corresponds to the form $Y_1(t) = A_1t + A_0$, since that's a generic polynomial of degree $1$. We have
	
	$$
		Y_1''' + 3Y_1'' + 3Y_1' + Y_1 &= t
		
		0 + 0 + 3A_1 + A_1t + A_0 &= t
		
		A_1 = 1, & A_0 = -3,
	$$
	
	so our first particular solution is $Y_1 = t - 3$. For the other, we have $Y_2 = Ae^t\cos(t) + Be^t\sin(t)$, and computing the first few derivatives gives us
	
	$$
		Y_2' &= Ae^t\cos(t) - Ae^t\sin(t) + Be^t\sin(t) + Be^t\cos(t)
		
		&= (A + B)e^t\cos(t) + (-A + B)e^t\sin(t)
		
		Y_2'' &= (A + B)e^t\cos(t) - (A + B)e^t\sin(t) + (-A + B)e^t\sin(t) + (-A + B)e^t\cos(t)
		
		&= 2Be^t\cos(t) - 2Ae^t\sin(t)
		
		Y_2''' &= 2Be^t\cos(t) - 2Be^t\sin(t) - 2Ae^t\sin(t) - 2Ae^t\cos(t)
		
		&= (2B - 2A)e^t\cos(t) + (-2A - 2B)e^t\sin(t).
	$$
	
	Plugging these into the initial DE, we have
	
	$$
		Y_2''' + 3Y_2'' + 3Y_2' + Y_2 &= 125e^t\sin(t)
		
		((2B - 2A) + 3(2B) + 3(A + B) + A)e^t\cos(t) + ((-2A - 2B) + 3(-2A) + 3(-A + B) + B) &= 125e^t\sin(t)
		
		(2A + 11B)e^t\cos(t) + (-11A + 2B)e^t\sin(t) &= 125e^t\sin(t)
	$$
	
	We must have that $2A + 11B = 0$ and $-11A + 2B = 125$. In total, we wind up with $A = -11$ and $B = 2$, and so we get a general solution of
	
	$$
		y = c_1 e^{-t} + c_2 t e^{-t} + c_3 t^2 e^{-t} + t - 3 - 11e^t\cos(t) + 2e^t\sin(t).
	$$
	
###

### exc "undetermined coefficients"
	
	Find the general solution to $y''' - 3y'' + 4y = 1 + e^{2t}$. (Hint: $r^3 - 3r^2 + 4 = (r - 2)^2(r + 1)$.)
