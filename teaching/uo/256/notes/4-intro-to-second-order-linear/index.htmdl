Let's take a moment to summarize where we are in the course so far. First-order DEs are complicated, but we have a handful of results about them. We can solve any first-order linear DE with integrating factors, and there are two special types of first-order nonlinear DEs --- separable and exact --- that we can solve with other methods. As a stark example of the general difficulty of the subject of differential equations, moving just one order higher will force us to narrow our scope drastically. We'll only be considering second-order linear DEs, and even then, it will take us a handful of sections to develop partial solving methods. It may come as little surprise that we will have a relatively small amount to say about third-order and higher DEs --- the difficulty curve is just drastic.

A general second-order DE has the form

$$
	F(y'', y', y, t) = 0,
$$

which is just a symbol-heavy way of saying it's an equation involving $y''$, $y'$, $y$, and $t$. The general study of these is beyond our scope, and we'll restrict our attention to second-order *linear* DEs, which have the form

$$
	f_2(t)y'' + f_1(t)y' + f_0(t)y = g(t).
$$

In other words, the function $F$ from before is a linear function of $y$, $y'$, and $y''$, but not necessarily of $t$. Since we'd expect solving for $y$ will require two integrations to get rid of the $y''$, and each integration produces an arbitrary constant, we'll typically need *two* initial conditions to solve for a particular solution. Most often, we'll have one of the form $y(t_0) = y_0$ as usual, and then another of the form $y'(t_0) = y'_0$, telling us the initial value of the derivative.

We're going to build up our theory of these DEs from the ground up, and the starting place is as simple as possible. Let's define a few terms and then outline the problem we're trying to solve.



### def "homogeneous DE"
	
	A linear DE is **homogeneous** if $g(t) = 0$. In other words, there is no constant term relative to $y$.
	
###



Our first type of second-order linear DEs will be homogeneous and constant-coefficient: that is, they'll be of the form

$$
	ay'' + by' + cy = 0
$$

for constants $a$, $b$, and $c$. Even in such a simple case, we have absolutely no tools to get started. Our best hope is just to guess a solution, so let's try to make it a good guess. Without any $t$s present anywhere, it seems reasonable that $e^t$ might be relevant to the solution. It's definitely not enough by itself, so let's try $e^{rt}$ for a variable $r$ and see if we can narrow down what it would need to be. We have

$$
	ar^2e^{rt} + bre^{rt} + ce^{rt} = 0,
$$

and $e^{rt}$ is never zero, so we can divide through by it to get

$$
	ar^2 + br + c = 0.
$$

Since $r$ is just a number, this is a regular quadratic equation! If we can solve for $r$, say $r = r_1$ and $r = r_2$, then we'll have our solutions: $y = e^{r_1t}$ and $y = e^{r_2 t}$. Actually, for any $c_1$ and $c_2$, a solution is

$$
	y = c_1e^{r_1 t} + c_2 e^{r_2 t}.
$$

To verify that, we just plug it back into the DE:

$$
	&\ \ a \left( c_1 r_1^2 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 r_2^2 e^{r_2 t} \right) + b \left( c_1 r_1 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 r_2 e^{r_2 t} \right) + c \left( c_1 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 e^{r_2 t} \right)
	
	&= c_1 e^{r_1 t} \left( ar_1^2 + br_1 + c \right) + c_2 e^{r_2 t} \left( ar_2^2 + br_2 + c \right)
	
	&= 0.
$$

This is an important enough technique that we'll want to give that quadratic equation its own name.



### def "characteristic equation"
	
	The **characteristic equation** for the second-order linear constant-coefficient homogeneous DE
	
	$$
		ay'' + by' + cy = 0
	$$
	
	is the quadratic equation
	
	$$
		ar^2 + br + c = 0.
	$$
	
###



Let's try using a characteristic equation in a concrete example to see how it works.



### ex "a characteristic equation"
	
	Solve $y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0$, given $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = 2$.
	
	The corresponding characteristic equation is
	
	$$
		r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0,
	$$
	
	which factors to give $r = -1$ and $r = -2$. These correspond to the solutions $y = e^{-t}$ and $y = e^{-2t}$, so our general solution is
	
	$$
		y = c_1e^{-t} + c_2e^{-2t}.
	$$
	
	Now our initial conditions give us
	
	$$
		y(0) = c_1 + c_2 &= 1
		y'(0) = -c_1 - 2c_2 &= 2,
	$$
	
	and by adding the equations together, we get $c_2 = -3$, so $c_1 = 4$. Our particular solution is therefore
	
	$$
		y = 4e^{-t} - 3e^{-2t}.
	$$
	
###

### exc "a characteristic equation"
	
	Solve $y'' = 4y$, given $y(0) = 4$ and $y'(0) = -4$.
	
###



We'll have to wait a little while before writing down the general method for solving this type of DE, but it will look a lot like the previous examples. Between here and there, we desperately need some theory --- is this method with the characteristic equation always going to work? How can we tell? Is there even guaranteed to be a unique solution to a second-order DE? To begin finding answers, let's first write down a general second-order homogeneous DE as an operator: for continuous functions $p$ and $q$, define $L$ by

$$
	L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y.
$$

We use brackets on $L$ for the same reason we do with operators like $\frac{d}{dt}$: its inputs are functions rather than just numbers. Setting $L[y] = 0$ gives us a general second-order homogeneous DE, and setting it equal to some other function $g(t)$ results in the more complicated nonhomogeneous case. Thankfully, even the complicated case is well-behaved with regard to the existence of solutions:



### thm "existence and uniqueness of solutions for second-order DEs"
	
	Let $p$, $q$, and $g$ be continuous functions and define the operator $L$ by
	
	$$
		L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y.
	$$
	
	Then the DE $L[y] = g(t)$, given $y(t_0) = y_0$ and $y'(t_0) = y'_0$, has a unique solution.
	
###



Earlier, we alluded to the idea that once we find two solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ --- which we typically call **fundamental solutions** --- we can take any linear combination $c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$ to produce a new solution. This is true in general, but for homogeneous DEs only.



### prop "combination of solutions"
	
	Define the operator $L$ by
	
	$$
		L[y] = y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y
	$$
	
	for continuous functions $p$ and $q$. If $y = y_1(t)$ and $y = y_2(t)$ are both solutions of $L[y] = 0$, then so is $y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$ for any $c_1$ and $c_2$.
	
###



There's no magic here: since derivatives split across addition and scalar multiplication, we have

$$
	L[c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2] = c_1 L[y_1] + c_2 L[y_2].
$$

In other words, $L$ is a **linear** operator. Since both $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions, this whole expression is zero and therefore also a solution. We'll have a lot more to say about linear operators later in the course, but this is all we'll need for now.

So we can produce many solutions with the previous proposition, but the big question that's still unanswered is whether we can get *all* of them that way: for any solution $y$ of $L[y] = 0$ with initial conditions $y(t_0) = y_0$ and $y'(t_0) = y'_0$, is there some choice of $c_1$ and $c_2$ so that $y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$? If that's the case, then we get a system of equations involving $c_1$ and $c_2$:

$$
	y(t_0) &= c_1 y_1(t_0) + c_2 y_2(t_0) &&= y_0
	
	y'(t_0) &= c_1 y_1'(t_0) + c_2 y_2'(t_0) &&= y'_0.
$$

When does this have a unique solution for $c_1$ and $c_2$? As with linear operators, we'll have a lot more to say about this in the future, but here's the result we'll need for now: we can represent this system as a **matrix**, which is a rectangular grid of numbers. It turns out that if all we care about is whether a unique solution exists, and not what it is exactly, then we don't need to worry about the right sides of the equations at all --- the only things that matter are the coefficients on $c_1$ and $c_2$. Arranging these into a $2 \times 2$ matrix gives us

$$
	[[ y_1(t_0), y_2(t_0) ; y_1'(t_0), y_2'(t_0) ]].
$$

Again, more on this in a few weeks, but the important result here is that the system of equations has a unique solution if and only if the **determinant** of this matrix is nonzero. The determinant of a matrix is a complicated operation in general, but it's not bad at all for a $2 \times 2$:

$$
	\det [[ a, b ; c, d ]] = ad - bc.
$$

In our case, we want to take the determinant of the particular $2 \times 2$ matrix made from our initial conditions, and it has a special name:



### def "the Wronskian"
	
	Let $p$ and $q$ be continuous functions and consider the second-order linear homogeneous DE
	
	$$
		y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y &= 0
		y(t_0) &= y_0
		y'(t_0) &= y'_0.
	$$
	
	Given two fundamental solutions $y = y_1(t)$ and $y = y_2(t)$, the **Wronskian** is the determinant
	
	$$
		W[y_1, y_2](t_0) = \det [[ y_1(t_0), y_2(t_0) ; y_1'(t_0), y_2'(t_0) ]].
	$$
	
	We often write this more concisely as just
	
	$$
		W[y_1, y_2] = \det [[ y_1, y_2 ; y_1', y_2' ]].
	$$
	
	The DE has a unique solution if and only if $W \neq 0$.
	
###



While there is a formula for actually finding $c_1$ and $c_2$ in terms of $W$ if we know it's nonzero, it's a mess to write down and involves two more determinants. Instead, it's easy enough to just solve the system of equations for $c_1$ and $c_2$ directly. Moreover, the true power of the Wronskian is that as long as it isn't *always* zero, we can produce all possible solutions to a given DE:



### thm "the Wronskian and general solutions"
	
	Let $p$ and $q$ be continuous functions and consider the second-order linear homogeneous DE
	
	$$
		y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y &= 0
	$$
	
	Given two fundamental solutions $y = y_1(t)$ and $y = y_2(t)$, if the Wronskian $W[y_1, y_2]$ is nonzero for *some* value of $t$, then all solutions of the DE are of the form $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$.
	
###



Let's (finally) return to an example and put all of this into practice.



### ex "solving a DE with the Wronskian"
	
	Solve $y'' + 6y' + 8y = 0$ and verify that you've found all possible solutions.
	
	The corresponding characteristic equation is
	
	$$
		r^2 + 6r + 8 &= 0
		
		(r + 2)(r + 4) &= 0,
	$$
	
	so $r = -2$ or $r = -4$. Our two solutions are then $y_1 = e^{-2t}$ and $y_2 = e^{-4t}$, so the Wronskian is
	
	$$
		W\left[ e^{-2t}, e^{-4t} \right] &= \det [[ e^{-2t}, e^{-4t} ; -2e^{-2t}, -4e^{-4t} ]]
		
		&= -4e^{-2t}e^{-4t} + 2e^{-4t}e^{-2t}
		
		&= -2e^{-6t}.
	$$
	
	This is never zero for any value of $t$, so in particular, it's nonzero for *some* value of $t$ --- say $t = 0$. Therefore, the general solution is
	
	$$
		y = c_1e^{-2t} + c_2e^{-4t}.
	$$
	
###

### exc "solving a DE with the Wronskian"
	
	Solve $2y'' + 8y' + 6y = 0$ and verify that you've found all possible solutions.
	
###



For a second-order linear homogeneous DE, we'll always be able to choose initial conditions to make the Wronskian nonzero, meaning there is always a general solution.

There is a fairly large question we've left implied so far: what if the roots of the characteristic equation are complex, or if they're the same? In the first case, we have the concerning sight of raising $e$ to a complex number, and in the second, there's only one fundamental solution when there should be two. We'll answer both questions in the next section, but for now, it's worth noting that our solving method works only for characteristic equations with distinct real roots.
